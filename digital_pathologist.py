def diagnose_crop_health(image_file_name: str, image_content_type: str):
    """
    Simulates the analysis of a crop image to diagnose a disease.

    In a real application, this function would:
    1. Load a pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., a PyTorch CNN).
    2. Pre-process the uploaded image to the right size and format.
    3. Feed the image to the model for prediction.
    4. Return the model's output.

    For now, we will just log the file details and return a hardcoded, mock diagnosis.

    Args:
        image_file_name (str): The name of the uploaded image file.
        image_content_type (str): The MIME type of the file (e.g., "image/jpeg").

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the simulated diagnosis.
