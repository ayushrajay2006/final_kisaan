    "Information from document 'pdf1.pdf' (Page 3):\nScheme Guidelines for CENTRAL SECTOR SCHEME of financing facility\nunder ‘Agriculture Infrastructure Fund’\n1 Introduction\nThe role of infrastructure is crucial for agriculture development and for taking the\nproduction dynamics to the next level. It is only through the development of infrastructure,\nespecially at the post-harvest stage that the produce can be optimally utilized with\nopportunity for value addition and fair deal for the farmers. Development of such\ninfrastructure shall also address the vagaries of nature, the regional disparities, development\nof human resource and realization of full potential of our limited land resource.\nIn view of above, the Hon’ble Finance Minister announced on 15.05.2020, ₹1 lakh\ncrore Agri Infrastructure Fund for farm-gate infrastructure for farmers. Financing facility of ₹\n1,00,000 crore will be provided for funding Agriculture Infrastructure Projects at farm-gate &\naggregation points Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies, Farmers Producer\nOrganizations, Agriculture entrepreneurs, Start-ups, etc. Impetus for development of farm-\ngate & aggregation point, affordable and financially viable Post Harvest Management\ninfrastructure.\nAccordingly, DA&FW has formulated the Central Sector Scheme to mobilize a medium\n- long term debt financing facility for investment in viable projects relating to post-harvest\nmanagement Infrastructure and community farming assets through incentives and financial\nsupport.\nSubsequently, in the budget announcement made on 01.02.2021, it was decided to\nextend the benefit of the scheme to APMCs. Accordingly, modifications in the scheme were\ncarried out with the approval of Cabinet to make it more inclusive.\n2 Rationale of the Scheme\nAgriculture and allied activities are the primary income source for ~58% of total\npopulation of India. ~85% of the farmers are Small Holding Farmers (SHFs) with less than 2\nhectares of land under cultivation and manage ~45% of agricultural land. Annual income of",
    "Information from document 'pdf1.pdf' (Page 4):\nmajority of the farmers is very low. Further, India has limited infrastructure connecting\nfarmers to markets and hence, 15-20% of yield is wasted which is relatively high in\ncomparison to other countries where it ranges between 5-15%. Investment in agriculture in\nIndia has further been stagnant with less than 2% CAGR over last 5 years. Investment in\nFY17 was ~ ₹ 2.19 lakh crore out of which private sector share was ~83% vs. a higher\ninvestment of ~ ₹ 2.50 lakh crore in FY14 and a higher share of private sector at ~88%. Also,\nlack of investor confidence is leading to lower plowback ratio (~14% of Gross Value addition\nin FY18) vs. other sectors (~33% of Gross Value addition in FY18).\n3 Objectives of the Scheme\nTo mobilize a medium - long term debt financing facility for investment in viable\nprojects for post-harvest management Infrastructure and community farming assets through\nincentives and financial support in order to improve agriculture infrastructure in the country.\nThis financing facility will fulfil numerous objectives for all the stakeholders in the agriculture\neco-system.\na. Farmers (including FPOs, PACS, Marketing Cooperative Societies, Multipurpose cooperative societies,\nState Agencies, Agricultural Produce Market Committees (Mandis), National & State Federations of\nCooperatives, Federations of FPOs and Federations of Self Help Groups (SHGs) etc.).\n- Improved marketing infrastructure to allow farmers to sell directly to a larger base\nof consumers and hence, increase value realization for the farmers. This will\nimprove the overall income of farmers.\n- With investments in logistics infrastructure, farmers will be able to sell in the\nmarket with reduced post-harvest losses and a smaller number of intermediaries.\nThis further will make farmers independent through improved access to market.\n- With modern packaging and cold storage system access, farmers will be able to\nfurther decide when to sell in the market and improve realization.\n- Community farming assets for improved productivity and optimization of inputs\nwill result in substantial savings to farmers.\nb. Government\n- Government will be able to direct priority sector lending in the currently unviable\nprojects by supporting through interest subvention, incentive through",
    "Information from document 'pdf1.pdf' (Page 5):\nconvergence and credit guarantee. This will initiate the cycle of innovation and\nprivate sector investment in agriculture.\n- Due to improvements in post-harvest infrastructure, government will further be\nable to reduce national food wastage percentage thereby enable agriculture\nsector to become competitive with current global levels.\n- Central/State Government Agencies or local bodies will be able to structure\nviable projects on their own or PPP projects for attracting investment in\nagriculture infrastructure.\nc. Agri-entrepreneurs and startups\n- With a dedicated source of funding, entrepreneurs will push for innovation in\nagriculture sector by leveraging new age technologies including IoT, AI, etc.\n- It will also connect the players in ecosystem and hence, improve avenues for\ncollaboration between entrepreneurs and farmers.\nd. Banking ecosystem\n- With Credit Guarantee, convergence and interest subvention lending institutions\nwill be able to lend with a lower risk. This scheme will help to enlarge their\ncustomer base and diversification of portfolio.\n- Refinance facility will enable larger role for cooperative banks and RRBs.\ne. Consumers\n- With reduced inefficiencies in post-harvest ecosystem, key benefit for consumers\nwill be a larger share of produce reaching the market and hence, better quality\nand prices. Overall, the investment via the financing facility in agriculture\ninfrastructure will benefit all the stakeholders in the eco-system.\n4 Implementation Period of Scheme\nThe Scheme will be operational from 2020-21 to 2032-33. Loan disbursement under\nthe scheme will complete in six years, i.e. by the end of Financial Year 2025-26. As on 31st\nDecember 2022, ₹14,118 crores have been sanctioned, out of which ₹9117 crores have\nbeen disbursed under the scheme. Remaining ₹90,883 crores out of ₹1 lakh crores will be\ndisbursed during the remaining period between 2022-23 and 2025-26. Repayment period\ncovered under the financing facility will be for a maximum period of 7 years including the",

Objective of the Scheme\nPradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) aims at supporting sustainable production in agriculture\nsector by way of\n• Providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of unforeseen events\n• Stabilizing the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming\n• Encouraging farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices\n• Ensuring flow of credit to the agriculture sector which will contribute to food security, crop\ndiversification and enhancing growth and competitiveness of agriculture sector besides protecting\nfarmers from production risks.\n2. Adoption of Technology for Scheme Administration:\n2.1 In an endeavour to integrate Technology in implementation and execution of the Scheme, the Govt. of\nIndia has designed and developed a National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP) (www. pmfby.gov.in). This\nwill bring in better administration and coordination amongst stakeholders viz. Farmers, States,\nInsurers and Banks as well as real time dissemination of information and transparency.\n2.2 The successful running of the Portal calls for responsible participation by different stakeholders who\nwill have the responsibility for census coding and updating revenue/administrative units, AWS code\nmapping and updating requisite information/details as per login credential module.\n2.3 Implementing States and Insurance Companies during each crop season are required to digitize and\nupload on the web Portal in the relevant module, basic information like notified areas, crops, sum\ninsured, Govt. subsidy, and premium to be paid by farmers and name of the implementing Insurance\nCompanies in the particular insurance unit etc., well within the prescribed time. This will facilitate\nfarmers and other stakeholders to get the relevant information on Internet and through SMS. State\nGovt. and concerned Insurance Company will be responsible for any incorrect entry/ errors/ omissions\netc.\n2.4 Digitization of basic information/notification should compulsorily be done before floating tender\ndocuments which will be followed by entry of bidded Premium rates and name of selected Insurance\nCompany immediately after finalization of bids and issue of work order.\n2.5 Since the National Crop Insurance Portal has been conceptualised for auto administration and\nseamless flow of data/information/reports on real time basis, State Govt. would not be allowed to\ncreate/use separate Portal/website for Crop Insurance purposes.\n2.6 All Stakeholders have defined roles and responsibilities and accessibility to related modules on the\nPortal for administration of the Scheme. Details of operationalization of modules for each\nstakeholder are available on the Portal for ready reference.",

However they may provide all requisite support to\nfacilitate Bank Branches/PACS for uploading the farmer’s details on the Portal well within the\nprescribed cut-off dates.\n2.9 Only farmers whose data is uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal shall be eligible for\nInsurance coverage and the premium subsidy from State and Central Govt. will be released\naccordingly.\n2.10 All data pertaining to crop-wise, area-wise historical yield data, weather data, sown area, coverage\nand claims data, calamity years and actual yield shall be made available on the National Crop\nInsurance Portal for the purpose of premium rating, claim calculation etc.\n2.11 Banks/Financial Institutions/other intermediaries need to compulsorily transfer the individual farmer’s\ndata electronically to the National Crop Insurance Portal. Accordingly Banks/FIs may endeavour to\nundertake CBS integration in a time bound manner for real time transfer of information/data.\n2.12 It is also proposed to develop an integrated platform/portal for both PMFBY and Interest Subvention\nScheme. The data/information of both the Schemes shall be auto synchronized to enable real time\nsharing of information and better program monitoring.\n2.13 Insurance Companies shall compulsorily use technology/mobile applications for monitoring of crop\nhealth/Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) in coordination with concerned States. States shall also\nfacilitate Insurance Companies with Satellite Imagery/Usage of Drones by way of prior approval of\nagency from which such data can be sourced. This is required for better monitoring and ground-\ntruthing. ICs can be active partners in facilitating use of technology.\n2.14 States shall adopt technology, such as satellite and UAV remote sensing, for various applications such\nas crop area estimation and yield disputes and also promote the use of remote sensing and other\nrelated technology for CCE planning, yield estimation, loss assessment, assessment of prevented\nsowing and clustering of districts.\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 2\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",

Further Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRIs) may be involved in extension and awareness\ncreation amongst farmers and obtaining feed-back of farmers about the implementation of the\nScheme\n3.1.4 The implementing Insurance Company selected as L1 will be responsible for taking necessary\nmeasures to ensure at least 10% incremental increase in coverage of non-loanee farmers. However\nother empanelled Insurance Companies which have participated in the bidding and are keen for\nenrolment of non loanee farmers in the cluster may also be allowed to enrol non-loanee farmers at L1\npremium rate. The interested companies have to inform their willingness in writing within seven days\nof finalisation of tender/issuance of work order to L1. It will however be the responsibility of all the\nInsurance Companies engaged in this process to ensure that duplicate enrolment does not happen in\nthe given cluster/district. Engaging companies other than L1 for enrolling non loanee farmers will be\ntaken up on a pilot basis in Districts notified by State Govt. They shall enrol non loanee farmers as per\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 3\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",

Annual Commercial / Annual Horticultural crops.\nIn addition for perennial crops, pilots for coverage can be taken for those perennial horticultural crops\nfor which standard methodology for yield estimation is available.\n5. Coverage of Risks and Exclusions\n5.1 Following stages of the crop risks leading to crop loss are covered under the Scheme. Addition of new\nrisks by the State Govt other than the one mentioned below, by the State Govt. is not permitted.\n5.1.1 Prevented Sowing/Planting/Germination Risk: Insured area is prevented from sowing/\nplanting/germination due to deficit rainfall or adverse seasonal/weather conditions.\n5.1.2 Standing Crop (Sowing to Harvesting): Comprehensive risk insurance is provided to cover yield losses\ndue to non-preventable risks, viz. Drought, Dry spell, Flood, Inundation, widespread Pests and Disease\nattack, Landslides, Fire due to natural causes ,Lightening, Storm, Hailstorm and Cyclone.\n5.1.3 Post-Harvest Losses: Coverage is available only upto a maximum period of two weeks from harvesting,\nfor those crops which are required to be dried in cut and spread / small bundled condition in the field\nafter harvesting against specific perils of Hailstorm, Cyclone, Cyclonic rains and Unseasonal rains.\n5.1.4 Localized Calamities: Loss/damage to notified insured crops resulting from occurrence of identified\nlocalized risks of Hailstorm, Landslide, Inundation, Cloud burst and Natural fire due to lightening\naffecting isolated farms in the notified area.\n5.1.5 Add-on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals: The States may consider providing\nadd-on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals wherever the risk is perceived to be\nsubstantial and is identifiable. Detailed protocol and procedure for evaluation of bids will be\nissued separately by GOI in consultation with Ministry of Environment and Forest and GIC Re. The\nadd-on coverage will be optional for the farmers and applicable notional premium will be borne by the\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 4\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",

The actuarial premium rates for add-on coverage should be sought in the bid\nitself from the Insurance Companies, however the add-on actuarial premium rate will be\nconsidered separately and shall not form part of evaluation of L1.\n5.1.6 General Exclusions: Losses arising out of war and nuclear risks, malicious damage and other\npreventable risks shall be excluded.\n5.1.7 State Govts./UTs ,in consultation with SLCCCI, can exclude any of the aforesaid perils listed above\nwhich is not prevailing in their State/UT\n5.1.8 Yield loss damage for localised calamities and post harvest losses will be assessed on the basis of\nindividual insured farm level and hence lodging of loss information by farmer/designated agencies\nis essential. For remaining risks losses are due to widespread calamities. Hence lodging of\ninformation for claims by insured farmers / designated agencies for such wise spread calamities is\nnot essential. Claims will be calculated based on the loss assessment report/average yield\nsubmitted by concerned State Govt.\n6. Preconditions for implementation of the Scheme\n6.1 States:\nIssuance of Notification by State Govt. / UT for implementation of the Scheme (PMFBY) will imply\ntheir acceptance of all provisions, modalities and guidelines of the Scheme. The main conditions\nrelating to PMFBY which are binding on States/UTs are as follows:\n6.1.1 Adoption of innovative technology especially Smart phones/ hand held devices for capturing conduct\nof CCEs through CCE-Agri App and use of NCIP platform for flow of information and auto\nadministration of the scheme\n6.1.2 State has to conduct requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) at the level of notified\ninsurance unit area;\n6.1.3 CCE based yield data will be uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal/submitted to Insurance\nCompany within the notified cut off date ;\n6.1.4 State/ UT will make necessary budgetary provision for premium subsidy based on fair estimates, at\nthe beginning of the crop season;\n6.1.5 To carry out pilot studies for improved yield estimations using technology.\n6.1.6 Department of State Govt. which was earlier looking after implementation of erstwhile National\nAgriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS)/ National Crop Insurance Programme (NCIP*) may be designated\nas Nodal Department for implementation of PMFBY. The State Level Coordination Committee on Crop\nInsurance (SLCCCI) which was overseeing implementation of NAIS and NCIP* may be authorized to\noversee implementation of PMFBY. The States/UTs which had not implemented the NAIS / NCIP* shall\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 5\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",

The present\ncomposition of SLCCCI may be strengthened by including representatives from State Horticulture\nDept., State Remote Sensing Application Centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Farmers’\nRepresentatives and empanelled Insurance Companies for implementing PMFBY. Chairman of SLCCCI\nmay co-opt representatives from other departments/agencies, if considered necessary.\n6.2 Insurance Company:\nEmpanelment of Insurance Companies and their participation for implementation of the Scheme\n(PMFBY) will imply their acceptance of all provisions, modalities and guidelines of the Scheme. The\nempanelled Insurance Companies have to deploy requisite infrastructure and resources for\nimplementation of PMFBY particularly for following identified major activities:\n6.2.1 To carry out Pilot study for leveraging new technology for effective implementation of Scheme in a\ntransparent manner,\n6.2.2 Deployment of requisite infrastructure to increase the outreach to rural farmers at their doorstep,\n6.2.3 Commitment for at least 10 % incremental increase in Non loanee coverage,\n6.2.4 Deployment of sufficient manpower to co-observe CCEs and allied activities and compulsory use of\nCCE Co-observation app,\n6.2.5 Allocation of requisite resources and commitment for advertisements, awareness generation and\ncapacity building of stakeholders about the Scheme. The detailed planning for the same should be\nsubmitted to Central and State Govt. in advance, before the start of each season.\n6.3 Submission of UID (AADHAAR) by farmer:\n6.3.1 Aadhaar has been made mandatory for availing Crop insurance from Kharif 2017 season onwards.\nTherefore, all banks are advised to mandatorily obtain Aadhaar number of their farmers and the same\napplies for non-loanee farmers enrolled through banks/Insurance companies/insurance\nintermediaries.\n6.3.2 Farmers not having Aadhaar ID may also enrol under PMFBY subject to their enrolment for\nAadhaar and submission of proof of such enrolment as per notification No. 334.dated 8th February,\n2017 issued by GOI under Section 7 of Aadhaar Act 2016(Targeted Delivery of Financial and other\nSubsidies, Benefits and Services). Copy of the notification may be perused on www.pmfby.gov.in. This\nmay be subject to further directions issued by Govt. from time to time.\n6.3.3 All banks have to compulsorily take Aadhaar/Aadhaar enrolment number as per notification\nunder Aadhaar Act before sanction of crop loan/KCC under Interest Subvention Scheme. Hence the coverage\nof loanee farmers without Aadhaar does not arise and such accounts need to be reviewed by the\nconcerned bank branch regularly.\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 6\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",

Notification\n7.1 Procedure for Issuance of Notification by the States/UTs:\n7.1.1 Prior to the commencement of the Kharif season, preferably in the beginning of November of previous\nyear, meeting of SLCCCI should be convened for finalising various terms and conditions and calling of\nbids/issuance of the bid notice to all empanelled Insurance Companies for selection to implement the\nScheme during the bid/ risk period. State / UT Govt. should ensure the issuance of the notification and\nits circulation to all concerned agencies/ departments/ institutions at least one month in advance of\nthe commencement of the crop season incorporating all the essential details about insured crops,\nareas, Scale of Finance, Sum Insured, Threshold Yield at insurance unit (IU) level for notified crops,\nperiod of contract, bidder’s evaluation and selection methodology, premium rate for farmers, Govt.\nsubsidy along with seasonality discipline/ cut off date for each activity etc. Notification should be\nissued for at least one year to facilitate banks for deduction of premium for a year\n7.1.2 In order to have transparency and system driven approach for crop insurance implementation, all the\ndetails as mentioned in para 7.1.1 above need to be part of the Tender Document and State\nNotification and no modification in the terms and condition enumerated in the tender document shall\nbe allowed post tendering.\n7.1.3 Bidding annexures may be generated through Portal. Procedure and template are available on\nNational Crop Insurance Portal. Before floating the Tender, last 10 years yield data at\nnotified/available level and TY at notified unit should be uploaded on the Portal in the given template\nand should be made part of the Tender.\n7.1.4 Calculation of lowest weighted premium of district shall be based on the insured areas of notified\ncrops in each district during last year/season. However, in absence of insured area of last year/season\nfor all proposed crops or any crop, net sown area of that crop(s) will be considered for calculation of\nweighted premium of district. This data will be used for calculation of L1 only.\n7.1.5 Bidding shall be done through e-tendering and work order may be released within 2 weeks of the\nopening of the Tender.\n7.1.6 Depending on the risk profile, historical loss cost and cost benefit analysis for the proposed crop(s) in\ndistrict(s) of any cluster, if the State Government feels that the premium rate likely to be offered by\nbidding Insurance Companies would be abnormally high, then the State Govt. can fix a ceiling on\npremium rates for such crop(s) proposed to be included in the bidding evaluation for the bidding\nperiod. However, recourse to this ceiling provision may be done only in well justified cases and not as\na general practice. The ceiling premium rate may be derived based on statistical evaluation/actuarial\npremium analysis, loss cost, historical payout etc and name of such crop should be disclosed by State\nGovt. compulsorily in the tender document.\n7.1.7 In such cases where a ceiling has been indicated, State government must call financial bids in two step\nbidding or in two separate envelopes. First bid/envelop is for disclosing the premium rate offered by\neach participating Insurance Company for such ceiling crops and must be categorised under “Ceiling\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 7\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",

All participating Insurance Companies\nhave to submit the bid offer as per the procedure mentioned above.\n7.1.8 State Govt. shall first evaluate first envelop of the bid keeping in view the premium offered by each\nindividual participating Insurance company and if the risk propensity and weather susceptibility of the\ncrop and/or historical claim/loss data doesn’t support the actuarial rates offered by the participating\nInsurance Companies, such crop(s) may be dropped from the list of proposed crops for notification by\nthe State Government and evaluation for L1 bidder should be done strictly based on the rates offered\nfor left out/remaining crops. The second envelope shall be opened by the State Govt. only after\ndecision on dropping the proposed crops/or accepting the premium rates offered by participating\nInsurance companies has been taken by the State Govt. If State Govt decides not to drop all proposed\ncrop(s)/ few crops for which premium rate obtained in separate envelop of “Ceiling Premium Rate”\nfrom the bidding process, then L1 will be calculated by inclusion of premium offered for all\ncrops/remaining crops.\n7.1.9 States should avoid doing re-tendering as a general practice. Re-tendering may be held only in\nexceptional circumstances and only with the prior approval of GOI after submission of a request with\ndetailed reasons. GOI on its part will give its decision within 5 working days of the receipt of the\nrequest.\n7.1.10 States are required to compulsorily upload Meeting Notices, Tender Documents, Addendums,\nrequisite data and other relevant information on the National Crop Insurance Portal for faster\ncommunication and response. Accordingly the subsequent notifications, circulars, directives shall also\nbe uploaded on the Portal as and when issued for wider reach and circulation.\n7.1.11 All conditions proposed to be stipulated by State Govt. should be incorporated in bid document itself\nand no new condition should be included in the notification. In case ICs have any objection to any\nTender condition which is in conflict with guidelines, they can make a reference to State govt. with a\ncopy to GOI within 3 days of issuance of Tender\n7.1.12 L1 bidder will not be allowed to withdraw their bid after opening of bids/allotment of work. If L1\nbidder withdraws then financial loss, if any, to the State Govt. due to retendering /assignment of\nwork to others, due to increase in actuarial premium rate from previously declared L1 rate, shall be\nrecovered from the withdrawing L1 bidder.\n7.2 Notification of Crops, Areas and Implementing Agency (IA)\n7.2.1 The Scheme shall operate on the principle of “Area Approach” in the selected defined areas called\nInsurance Unit (IU). State Govt. /UT will notify crops and defined areas covered during the season in\naccordance with decision taken in the meeting of SLCCCI. State/UT Govt. should notify Village/Village\nPanchayat or any other equivalent unit as an insurance unit for major crops defined at District /\nTaluka or equivalent level. For other crops it may be a unit of size above the level of Village/village\nPanchayat.

The level and name of notified area of insurance unit\nmust be part of notification and should be provided at the time of bidding itself.\n7.2.5 In case State Govts/UT proposes to notify irrigated and un-irrigated areas under a crop separately,\nthey shall ensure that minimum CCEs are planned and conducted for irrigated and un-irrigated crops\nseparately in such areas. In addition, past yield data for requisite number of years will have to be made\navailable separately for both\n7.2.6 While notifying the crop(s) where a specific conversion factor is being used for reporting of yield such\nas in the case of rice/paddy etc, due care should be taken by the State Nodal Department to use the\nrelevant specific nomenclature for disclosure of Average Yield, Threshold Yield and Actual Yield while\nreleasing the Tender Document and submission of Yield data and CCE data for calculation of admissible\nclaims. Insurance Companies will also be responsible for prior scrutiny of Tender document.\nInformation/data provided in Tender document will be treated as final and in case of any error/\nmisreporting/disparity, State Govt. and Insurance Company will be equally liable for payment of\nadditional claims arising on account of it, if any.\n7.2.7 For the current season or subsequent seasons (in a multi-year contract), the States, if required, can\nnotify additional IUs or de-notify certain IUs subject to maximum deviation of 10% of already notified\nIUs for the crop within a district at the same premium rate, before the cut-off date for debit of\npremium. If the deviation is >10% or in case of addition of new crop, actuarial premium rate may be\nworked out either by calculation of weighted average premium rate as prevalent in contiguous\ndistricts or by applying appropriate loading on the existing premium rate. The rates for such crops will\nbe determined /verified by TSU and its decision will be binding on both States and ICs.\n7.2.8 States implementing PMFBY at Village/ Village Panchayat level for major crops shall be entitled for\n50% reimbursement of incremental expenses of CCEs and cost of smart phones/ improved\ntechnology from GOI.

Hence, Banks must ensure that they debit farmers premium within 15\ndays from sanction/renewal of KCC/crop loan, failing which banks will be liable to meet the claim\nliabilities of uncovered eligible famers. Banks are therefore advised to debit loanee farmers premium\nat least one month before cut-off date for enrolment to avoid this situation and in case sanction\nhappens within one month of cut-off date, banks may daily debit premium for such accounts.\n17.4.4 Detailed example for Calculation of crop-wise Sum Insured for the season for compulsory coverage is\ngiven in Table 3 below:\nCrop 1 Crop 2 Crop 3 Crop 4 Crop 5 Crop 6\n\nTotal Land Ownership (Ha) Kharif Rabi\nName of Crop Paddy Maize Cotton Wheat Potato Gram\nActual Sown Area (Ha) under the crop 5 2 1 6 1 1\nArea (Ha) declared in KCC application 2 1 1 2 1 1\nCrop Season Kharif Rabi\nScale of Finance (Rs./Ha) 50,000 40,000 60,000 50,000 70,000 30,000\nTotal Sanctioned Sub limit for crop cultivation 1,00,000 40,000 60000 1,00,000 70,000 30,000\nSeason-wise sub limit for crop cultivation 2,00,000 2,00,000\nAdditional loan amount for consumption and\n1,20,000\nmaintenance of machinery etc (max.

The dispute can be brought to TAC, only in the case, where all of the following\nconditions are satisfied. All conditions not falling in these criteria shall be decided by SLCC and their\ndecision shall be final and binding on all concerned.\n• There is more than 25% difference between the yield estimated by the State government and the\ninsurance company.\n• There is sufficient documentary evidence that the CCEs have not been conducted in required\nnumber and following the standard protocol, in at least 20% area of the IUs for the particular crop\nin the Cluster.\n• The matter has been considered by the SLCC and STAC but could not be resolved at State level.\n• The Insurance Company has already carried out technical analysis of data in consultation of State\nGovt. or in collaboration with Central/State agencies and has used satellite/model/weather data to\nsupport its claim.\n19.7.2 The Organizations to which TAC can refer the case to: The organizations can be Central Govt. or\nautonomous organizations, which have requisite capacity to carry out such analyses, such as: MNCFC\n(DAC&FW), SAC (ISRO), NRSC (ISRO) and other similar government/non-government organizations (e.g.\nCCAFS-BISA-CGIAR), as decided by TAC. Hereafter, these organizations will be referred to as Technical\nAgencies.\n19.7.3 Data to be provided by State Government:\n• All CCEs data of the contested area, in digital format, (preferably Excel), along with photographs\nand other collateral data, as collected during CCE. The CCE data should be ideally geo referenced.\n• Village level crop area estimates.\n• Long term (at least 10 years) data of crop yield at GP level (if not available, at least at Taluka/block\nlevel) in digital format, (preferably Excel)\n• Long term (at least 10 years) data of weather parameters (daily or weekly) at GP level (if not\navailable, at least at Taluka /block level).

The steps in g and h are compulsory.\n• Statistical analysis of the CCE yield data: Basic Statistical Parameters (Mean, Variance, CV, Range,\nStandard Error, etc.) Scatter plots, Test of Normality (Shapiro-Wilk test, Quartile- Quartile plot,\nWhiskers box plot, Skewness and Kurtosis, etc.). It also needs to be checked whether CCEs were\ndone using the proper sampling design. Village level crop area may also be checked to identify\nreasons for lower number of CCE.\n• Analysis of Weather Data: Weekly Rainfall Deviations (at least at block level) or at grid level using\ngridded or satellite based data, Dry-spell Occurrence, Temperature Anomaly, Soil Moisture Analysis\n(either from satellite or model data) and any other available weather parameters (related to crop\ncondition), either from ground or satellite data. Another rainfall based index, which can also be\nstudied, is Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). SPI can be developed using IMD gridded rainfall\ndata or NOAA CPC rainfall data. However, while using gridded data (either from satellite or ground\nstations), appropriate resolution should be used at appropriate level. For example, 0.25 degree\ndata should be used only at district level and not at block/village level. High resolution weather\ndata can also be sourced from weather companies.\n• Analysis of Long-term Yield Data: Previous 10 years’ yield data (at GP or Taluka level) analysis\nshould be carried out to assess the ups and downs. The analysis would include yield ranges, mean\nyield, standard deviation, and CV.\n• Analysis of Other collateral data: Other data or reports, which should be considered, include Crop\nWeather Watch Report, NSSO Supervised CCE data, FASAL programme crop reports, drought\nassessment reports prepared by MNCFC, Market arrivals and prices data for 2-3 years\n(http://agmarknet.gov.in/), crop condition data available on VEDAS platform\n(https://vedas.sac.gov.in/vedas/), Disaster maps available on Bhuvan platform, IMD weather\nbulletins, weather information/forecasts available on MOSDAC (https://www.mosdac.gov.in/),\netc.\n• Analysis of Vegetation Index from Satellite Data: The vegetation index, which can be used for this\npurpose are Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Wetness Index\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 34\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",
    "Information from document 'pdf10.pdf' (Page 40):\n(NDWI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition index (TCI), Vegetation Health\nIndex (VHI), Enhance Vegetation Index (EVI), etc. To derive these indices, satellite data of\nappropriate resolution should be used (Table 6).\nTable 6 : Types of resolution to be used for vegetation index derivation for different levels of\nanalysis\nLevel of Spatial Examples of Satellite/Sensor\nAnalysis Resolution\nto be used\nVillage level 5-10 m or Resourcesat 2/2A: LISS IV (5.8m), Sentinel 2:MSI (10 m); Rapid Eye (6.5\nbetter m); SPOT 5 HRG (5,10 m)\nBlock/Tehsil 10-30 m Resourcesat 2/2A: LISS III (23.5 m), Landsat 8: OLI (30 m); Sentinel 2:MSI\nlevel (10 m)\nDistrict level 50-100 m Resourcesat 2/2A: AWiFS (56 m); Proba V (100 m)\nHowever, wherever long-term satellite data is needed MODIS (250 m) data can be used, but it should\nnot be used for village level for information. Ideally for deriving crop specific vegetation indices, crop\nmaps should be overlaid on the data. Generally for few major crops, crop maps are prepared under\nFASAL project of DAC&FW. Crop maps can be generated using either optical or microwave remote\nsensing (SAR) data of appropriate resolution. Wherever, crop maps are not available, at least\nagricultural area map should be used. For assessing NDVI or NDWI deviation percentage, data of latest\n2-3 years should be used or at least data of a normal crop year should be used.\n• Crop Growth Modelling: Yield loss estimates can be made using crop simulation models such as\nDSSAT/ InfoCrop, etc. Remote sensing based semi-physical modelling approach can also be used\nfor crop growth analysis. However, care should be taken to use well calibrated and validated\nmodels and also models should be run in spatial at higher resolution, at least 5 km.\n• Identification of Outliers: All these above analyses can be used to check whether there was any\nreason for yield deviation as presented in the CCE data. Then a yield proxy map may be prepared.\nThe Yield proxy map can be derived from remote sensing vegetation indices (single or\ncombination of indices), crop simulation model output, or an integration of various parameters,\nwhich are related to crop yield, such as soil, weather (gridded), satellite based products, etc.\nWhatever, yield proxies to be used, it is the responsibility of the organization to record\ndocumentary evidence (from their or other’s published work) that the yield proxy is related to the\nparticular crop’s yield. Then the IU level yields need to be overlaid on the yield proxy map. Both\nyield proxy and CCE yield can be divided into 4-5 categories (e.g. Very good, Good, Medium, Poor,\nVery poor). Wherever there is large mismatch between yield proxy and the CCE yield (more than 2\nlevels), the CCE yield for that IU can be considered, as outliers.\n• Computing Yield for the Outliers: For the IUs, where the yield was considered as outlier, the yield\nmay be estimated by developing empirical models (statistically significant) between long-term\nyield data (at IU level or, if not available, higher administrative level) and weather and remote\nsensing based index data. Using these models, yield for the concerned year should be estimated.\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 35\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY\n\nThe following is a table with important data:\n| Level of\nAnalysis | Spatial\nResolution\nto be used | Examples of Satellite/Sensor |\n| Village level | 5-10 m or\nbetter | Resourcesat 2/2A: LISS IV (5.8m), Sentinel 2:MSI (10 m); Rapid Eye (6.5\nm); SPOT 5 HRG (5,10 m) |\n| Block/Tehsil\nlevel | 10-30 m | Resourcesat 2/2A: LISS III (23.5 m), Landsat 8: OLI (30 m); Sentinel 2:MSI\n(10 m) |\n| District level | 50-100 m | Resourcesat 2/2A: AWiFS (56 m); Proba V (100 m) |",
    "Information from document 'pdf10.pdf' (Page 41):\nThe final yield can be estimated as a combination of CCE Yield and model estimated. The\nweightage to be given to each estimate will depend upon the quality of each estimate (CCE or\nModel). Low weightage should be given to CCE not conducted properly (without photograph, geo\nlocation, proper sampling plan etc.). Similarly lower weightage to be given model estimates, if\nmodel is statistically not highly significant. Wherever, if the model was not statistically significant\nthe average of estimated yields of adjacent blocks should be used (Note: Each and every case may\nhave specific and special cause related to a problem and may not be considered as a reference for\nany other case.) Each time, the stage of the crop should be given prior importance e.g. 10 mm\nrainfall at vegetative stage and at harvest or post-harvest stage has different impacts; a small\namount rainfall having devastating wind-speed have different impact than high amount of rainfall\nhaving calm or no-wind. The Technical Agency needs to take into account all these factors to\nconsider each of the cases as an individual and special case.\n19.7.6 Time required for the analysis: The analysis needs to be completed by the concerned technical\nagency, within one month of receipt of all mentioned data from the Insurance Company and the State\nGovernment.\n19.7.7 Funds needed for the analysis: All the analysis will be carried out by the Technical Agency, with its\nexisting resources. However, if there is any need of procurement of priced data or services, this may\nbe funded by the concerned Insurance Agency or the State Government, whichever organization has\nbrought the dispute issue up to TAC.\n19.7.8 General Suggestions: Though this SOP identifies the procedure for yield dispute resolutions, in a long\nrun, it will benefit the scheme and the farmers, if there is no Dispute. Following suggestions are made\nto avoid dispute.\n• The States should conduct the CCEs following the standard procedure (proper sampling plan) and\ncollect the data using Smartphone based Android App\n• States need to pro-actively use technology for more accurate crop yield estimation\n• States should develop mechanism to resolve disputes at State level by technical support from State\nlevel organizations, such as Agricultural Universities, State Remote Sensing Centres, ICAR Centres\nlocated in the State, local IMD office, etc.\n• The Insurance Companies should proactively, get involved with the States for supervision of CCEs.\n• The Insurance Companies should more and more invest in use of technology to support the loss\nassessment.\n• There should be better coordination between the State and the Insurance Companies.\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 36\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",
    "Information from document 'pdf10.pdf' (Page 42):\n20. Use of Innovative Technologies\n20.1 To Rationalize CCEs: With availability of a number of satellites with high resolution imaging\ncapability orbiting the Earth, there is a great improvement in satellite remote sensing based products.\nIt has been reasonably proven that satellite based vegetation indices (such as, Normalized Difference\nVegetation Index, NDVI and Normalized Difference Wetness Index, NDWI) can help in demarcating the\ncropped areas into clusters on the basis of crop health. This feature can be successfully used to target\nthe CCEs within the Insurance Unit (IU). In other words, satellite imagery can help in ‘smart sampling’\n(stratified sampling) of CCEs. This will help in optimizing the number of CCEs, to make them\nrepresentative of different crop conditions. This is expected to reduce the total need of CCEs by about\n30-40% while maintaining similar accuracy. It will also give a more representative yield of the IU, as it\nwill consider all crop pixels (fields) within the IU and not just location of 4 CCEs. States can adopt this\ntechnique (of using satellite based remote sensing data for planning of Crop Cutting Experiments) in\ngenerating yield estimates while following digital protocol outlined in the preceding paragraphs. For\nusing satellite data for smart sampling, there is a need to generate specific crop map. MNCFC under\nthe FASAL project of the DAC&FW prepares crop maps for various crops, as mentioned in Section 25,\npara 25.4. These crop maps can be used for CCE planning. Vegetation Indices (NDVI and NWDI) need to\nbe computed for the cropped area. On the basis of Vegetation Index, the crop area can be categorized\ninto poor, medium, good and very good crop health strata. Within each stratum, CCE points should be\nselected randomly. Additionally, ground truthing within these IUs can be done in order to develop crop\nyield model to ascertain yield estimation of the crop and simultaneously can act as a\nreconciliation/verification tool of actual CCEs conducted on the field. This can be done in consultation\nwith MNCFC, NRSC (ISRO), SAC (ISRO), SRSC and IASRI. This Department has also been piloting such\nstudies, in this regard, for optimization/reduction of crop cutting experiments using technology.\n20.2 To remove Area Discrepancy in coverage: It is noticed that in some instances in States/districts,\narea insured is much more than area sown figures hence, compulsory use of RST/ satellite imagery,\ndigitization of land records needs to be done to minimize the area discrepancy. For this detailed\nprocedure has been laid down in section 25\n20.3 For Direct Yield Estimation\n20.3.1 For addressing the issue of reliability of CCEs in terms of their accuracy, representativeness and\ntimeliness, innovative technologies such as satellite remote sensing, drone, modeling, AWS/ARG, real\ntime transmission of data etc. should be utilized. This will ensure accurate assessment of yield and\ntimely payment of claims to farmers. Various studies carried out by national and international\norganizations, including MNCFC, NRSC, SAC, CCAFS, IRRI, IFPRI, World Bank, etc. have shown that the\nuse of satellite, weather, soil and crop data, along with images/video capture of crop growth at various\nstages and accurate sample CCE data collection can improve the yield data quality/ timeliness and\nsupport timely claim processing and payments.\n20.3.2 States, with the support of national centres as mentioned above, SRSC and SAUs, need to carry out\nadequate number of pilot studies for improved yield estimation using technology, as mentioned\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 37\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",
    "Information from document 'pdf10.pdf' (Page 43):\nabove, and small number of good quality CCEs. When a significant correlation is observed between\nremote sensing and weather estimated yield and yield estimated through CCEs, States and Insurance\nCompanies can use these technologies in estimating the crop yields at IU level, subject to the\nsatisfaction of both States and Insurance Companies about the accuracy of the yield estimates, to\nservice the claims.\n20.4 To improve Yield-data Quality and Timeliness\n20.4.1 It has been observed that the normall CCE process being followed by the State for estimating yield is\nlacking in reliability, accuracy and speed, which affects claim settlement. There is a need for real\ntime, good quality and reliable actual yield-data for which mandatory use of smart phones / hand held\ndevices has to be done for capturing images, location of the CCE and for online transmission of data on\nNational Crop Insurance Portal through CCEs Agri-app. RST using satellite and drones, weather data,\nmodel etc. may also be used for the purpose of increasing accuracy and speed of yield estimation\nthrough CCEs.\n20.4.2 The cost of using technology etc. for conduct of CCE process specially purchase of smart phones/ hand\nheld devices and use of technology (RST, Drone etc.) will be shared between Central Govt. and State\nGovts/ U.Ts on 50:50 basis, wherever necessary, subject to a cap on total funds to be made available by\nCentral Govt. for this purpose based on approximate cost of procuring handheld devices/smart phones\nand other related costs (RST, Drone, etc).\n20.5 Technology Fund: A technology fund will be created by GOI wherein resources shall be allocated for\nmeeting 5% of GOI share/100% grant in various technological interventions undertaken by State Govt.\nfunds as admissible. The fund shall be augmented with excess farmers share of premium surrendered\nby Insurance Company due to application of ACF and penalties imposed on Insurance Companies on\naccount of poor performance by Insurance Companies as per the parameters outlined in Annexure 2\n21. Assessment of Claims\n21.1 Wide Spread Calamities\n21.1.1 If ‘Actual Yield’ (AY) per hectare of insured crop for the insurance unit (calculated on basis of requisite\nnumber of CCEs) in insured season, falls short of specified ‘Threshold Yield’ (TY), all insured farmers\ngrowing that crop in the defined area are deemed to have suffered shortfall of similar magnitude in\nyield. PMFBY seeks to provide coverage against such contingency.\n‘Claim’ shall be calculated at IU level as per the following formula:\n(Threshold Yield – Actual Yield)\n——————————————— X Sum Insured\nThreshold Yield\nWhere Threshold Yield (TY) for a crop in a notified insurance unit is the average yield of best 5 years\nfrom past seven years of that season multiplied by applicable Indemnity Level for that crop\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 38\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",

The details of individual insured farmers are being\ncollected on National Crop Insurance Portal for de duplication. However, in the absence of digitized\nfarm records on a GIS platform and its integration with the Portal, it would be cumbersome to\nphysically verify each farm when the reported discrepancies are comparatively large compared to the\nsown areas. Moreover, the scheme also covers the risk of prevented sowing/germination failure which\nis not being included in sowing areas furnished by the State Government for arriving of sown area of\ncrop the during the season. State wise List of such major crops will be notified by DAC&FW in\nconsultation with MNCFC from time to time before beginning of every season.\n25.2 Under the scheme, notified crops are being insured by the Insurance companies on the basis of\nactuarial premium rate, hence, it is not their prerogative to reduce the Sum Insured and resultant\nclaims on the application of ACF. However, to rationalize the government subsidy, it the\nresponsibilities of all concerned stakeholders including farmers and financial institutions to insured the\ncrop which farmer actually intend to sow/actually sown. Option to change the insured crop has also\nbeen provided under the scheme for reporting of crop(s) actually sown for the insurance. There is\nalso a provision to indemnify the crop losses due to localized perils on the basis of survey of\nindividual plot/field under insured crops. Any wrong reporting of insured crops may lead to\nforfeiting of claims, if the crop actually sown and insured will be different.\n25.3 Area Discrepancy will be applied only to those major crops for which Normal area sown data at the\nBlock/Taluka level shall be provided by MNCFC based on the remote sensing data etc after factoring\nthe areas remains unsown and failed germination/plantation due to adverse climatic conditions and\nshall be made available on National Crop Insurance Portal. No other data from any source including\nState Govt. will be considered.\n25.4 However, any mass irregularities/anomalies in insuring of excess area i.e. more than the published\ncultivable area at Taluka level should compulsorily be brought to the notice of DAC&FW, in writing\nafter cut off date of enrolment but before the period specified for reconciliation with banks along with\nfacts/documents and list of bank branches etc so that the same may be examined by the Government\nand rectified by concerned bank itself before finalisation of business Statistics for the season on Portal\n25.5 Decision of GOI in applicability of discrepancy in insured area shall be binding on all.\n25.6 If the difference between insured area and sown area provided by MNCFC is >30% at Block/Tehsil/\nTaluka , all IUs of such Block/Tehsil/ Taluka will fall under acreage discrepancy category and should be\ntreated as having ‘excess’ insurance coverage.\n25.7 Data on application of ACF shall be uploaded on National Crop Insurance Portal.\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 57\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",

Publicity and Awareness\n26.1 Adequate publicity needs to be given in all the villages of the notified districts/areas. All possible\nmeans of electronic and print media, farmer’s fair, exhibitions, SMS, short films, and documentaries\nshall be utilized to create and disseminate awareness about provisions and benefits of the Scheme\namong the cultivators and the agencies involved in implementing the Scheme. Agriculture/\nCooperation Departments of the State shall work out appropriate plan for awareness generation and\npublicity on an on-going basis from three months prior to the start of coverage period. Similarly,\nInsurance Companies will conduct Publicity and Awareness immediately on receipt of award of work.\nAll the publicity material/ information should necessarily be uploaded on the National Crop Insurance\nPortal along with coverage/frequency/ duration date etc.\n26.2 The State Govt./ UT in collaboration with Insurance Companies shall also chalk out plan for capacity\nbuilding of the associated agents, banks etc for effective implementation of the Scheme and organize\ntraining workshops/ sensitization programme for them in association with participating Insurance\nCompanies.\n26.3 Insurance company should spend 0.5% of the total gross premium for publicity expenses at the field\nlevel and the corresponding details should be submitted to GOI and State govt. at the end of every\nseason. In case of expenditure in this category is less than 0.5% of Total Gross Premium, the IC shall\ndeposit the difference in Technology fund within 3 months of cut off date for enrolment.\n27. Service Charges\n27.1 To Banks\n27.1.1 Bank and other financial institutions etc. shall be paid service charges @ 4% of the farmer’s share of\npremium by Insurance Company as generated from the Portal and within the 15 days of finalization of\nbusiness statistics. Rural agents engaged in providing insurance related services to farmers may be\npaid appropriate commission as decided by Insurance Company, subject to cap prescribed under IRDAI\nregulations. If there is delay in payment of service charges by Insurance Company beyond 15 days of\nfinalization of business statistics, amount needs to be paid with interest @12% p.a.\n27.1.2 Even if the farmer’s share of premium is contributed/financed by the concerned State Govt. the\napplicable service charges shall be paid by the concerned Insurance Company only.\n27.1.3 No service charges will be payable to the concerned bank/branch for the applications for which any\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 58\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",

Monitoring and Review of the Scheme\n29.1 State Level Coordination Committee on Crop Insurance (SLCCCI) of the concerned State will be\nresponsible for monitoring of the Schemes/programme in its State. However, a National Level\nMonitoring Committee (NLMC) under the chairmanship of Secretary, DAC & FW will monitor the\nScheme at the national level.\n29.2 It is proposed to take following monitoring measures for effective implementation during each crop\nseason to ensure maximum benefits to the farmers:\n29.2.1 The Bank branches/CSCs/ intermediaries may collect the details of individual insured farmers (both\nloanee and non-loanee) like name, fathers’ name, Bank Account number, Aadhaar number village,\ncategories – small and marginal/SC/ST/women, insured acreage, insured crop(s), sum insured,\npremium collected, Govt. subsidy etc and submit electronically using web form or CBS Integration\nmodule along with electronic submission of crop wise consolidated declarations on or before final cut-\noff date.. Yield data based on CCEs shall be made available online on National Crop Insurance Portal to\nthe concerned Insurance Company by the State Govt. within a month from the date of final harvest of\nindividual crop.\n29.2.2 Calculation of ACF if any shall be made immediately after receipt of insured acreage and sown area\ndata but not later than the onset of CCEs similarly any anomaly in the actual yield data shall\nimmediately be brought into the notice of concerned State Govt. and not later than 15 days from final\nreceipt of actual yield data as detailed in section 25.\n29.2.3 Insurance Companies shall calculate crop-wise, IU wise payable claims based on the actual yield data\nand threshold yield given at the time of tendering.

Empanelment and Selection of Insurance Companies\n31.1 Empanelment Criteria\n31.1.1 The Public Sector (AIC& others) and Private Sector General Insurance Companies empanelled by DAC\n& FW and selected by concerned State Govt. / Union Territory (UT) shall implement the PMFBY. The\nInsurance Companies mainly engaged in agriculture/rural insurance business and having adequate\nexperience, infrastructure, financial strength and operational capabilities are empanelled by DAC&FW.\nOnce Insurance Company has been empanelled by DAC &FW, it is considered as pre-qualified\ncompany to bid for the selection of Implementing Agency (IA) to undertake implementation of the\nScheme/Programme of DAC&FW.\n31.1.2 L1 bidder shall not be permitted to surrender partial clusters/districts. If any Insurance Company declines\nafter being declared L1, it will be de-empanelled/ de-barred to implement crop insurance Scheme for\nthe coming/next season(s) in the concerned State and L2 may be given the cluster for implementing\nthe crop insurance Scheme at L1 district-crop combination rates and so on to L3, L4 bidder with their\nconsent. All Such bidders will be required to simultaneously furnish appropriate reasons for\nwithdrawal/surrender/non acceptance in writing to State Govt. with copy to DAC&FW to enable further\ncorrective measures and appropriate administrative & legal action accordingly. Financial losses, if any, to\nthe State Govt., in retendering due to withdrawal of selected bidders, will be recovered from withdrawing\nL1 bidder.\n31.1.3 Tender should be preferably for 3 years and in no case less than 1 year\n31.1.4 Each Insurance Company should compulsorily bid for any 3 NER/Hilly States and 2 UTs\n31.2 Selection Criteria of Insurance Companies as Implementing Agency (IA)\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 61\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",
    "Information from document 'pdf10.pdf' (Page 67):\n31.2.1 The selection of Insurance Company from the empanelled Insurance Companies to act as\nImplementing Agency (IA) shall be done by the concerned State/UT Govt. for implementation of the\nScheme in their State. Selection of IA will be made by adopting the cluster approach. In case of smaller\nStates, the whole State may be assigned to one IA.\n31.2.2 Before the commencement of the crop season, State Govt. would invite the pre-qualified companies\nas mentioned in the preceding para through open tender for submission of district-wise and crop-\nwise actuarial premium rates in percentage of Sum Insured (financial bid). Indemnity Level,\nThreshold Yields, Sum Insured etc. will be same for all Insurance Companies for the season. The\nempanelled companies participating in bidding have to bid the premium rates for all the crops notified\n/ to be notified in the cluster by the State Govt. and non-compliance will lead to rejection of the bid.\n31.2.3 Based on the district-wise and crop-wise actuarial premium rates quoted by the pre-qualified\ncompanies, the total premium amount and weighted average premium rates for cluster of districts will\nbe worked out to arrive at L1. L1 Bidder will be selected to act as Implementing Agency in the\nconcerned cluster.\n31.2.4 Selection of IA may be made for at least 1 year or up to three years as mentioned above Such long\nterm continuity will facilitate the Insurance Company to establish the credibility among the farmers\nthrough investment out of the premium savings in various welfare activities for socio-economic\ndevelopment of the farmers like creation of the facilities of drinking water/ healthcare/education,\nfarm levelling, Weather Forecasts, CSCs etc. It is also anticipated that long term continuity gives an\nopportunity to Insurers, Bankers, State Govt. and other stakeholders for a supportive and collaborative\ninteraction and business relationship and service effectiveness.\n31.2.5 The insurance coverage in terms of number of farmers and acreage should be at least at the level of\ncorresponding previous season. In case of fall in coverage, GOI may get the facts examined and\nnecessary action including penal action against negative points in ranking for ICs and State Govt., if\nfound at fault may be taken by GOI.\n31.2.6 State Govt. may provide requisite data about past yield data of last 10 consecutive years or more,\nthreshold yield, crop-wise sum insured, indemnity level, insurance unit levels, names of notified units,\ncalamity years etc. in digital form by uploading the same on National Crop Insurance Portal itself\nbefore floating the formal tender notice.\n32. Clustering /clubbing of districts for bidding by the State\nIn order to diversify/ spread the risk and cover high risk/ low risk districts/ area equally, the State\nGovernment are required to group the districts/ area in such a way that each group contains mix of\ndistricts/ area with different risk profiles. Prior to inviting the bid, the State Government specially large\nState have to divide the State in to multiple clusters of districts depending upon volume of risk\nassociated in the crops and district/areas proposed to be notified under the Scheme. The purpose of\nclustering is to divide the States into different groups of districts, so that expected sum insured (ESI)\nbecomes low and risk is shared and diversified. States may form the clusters of districts based on\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 62\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",
    "Information from document 'pdf10.pdf' (Page 68):\nmixed agro-climatic zones. i) Districts of high risk and low risk areas, ii) districts of different agro-\nclimatic zones, and iii) ESI is of each cluster should be of similar order.\nPrior to the bid invitation, details on the clusters formation may also be made available to the\nInsurance Companies.\nThe object of Clustering/ Clubbing of districts should be done to achieve the following objectives:\n• Cluster formation may be applicable for upto 3 years.\n• Different Clusters may be defined based on risk profile of the district so as to increase the\ndiversification of risk within a cluster and enable risk spreading for insurer.\n• Cluster may contain districts with mixed agro-climatic zones so as to increase the diversification of\nrisk within a cluster.\n• Crop wise associated risk may also be diversified among the clusters and shall be factored in\ncluster formation.\n1. Hence, one of the major requirements of clustering is risk analysis of different districts. As per 2016\nGuidelines of PMFBY, for the purpose of clustering/clubbing of districts and determination of L1\nbidder, the risk is analyzed based on long term data of yield by (a) computing average burn cost\n(percent difference between actual yield and threshold yield) and b) computing the level of variability\nin long term yield. Since, availability of high quality long term yield data is difficult, especially at lower\nadministrative level, other methods (including use of satellite data) can be tried for risk assessment.\n2. Satellite data, of moderate resolution (e.g. Resourcesat AWiFS, Terra/Aqua MODIS) are available, for\nlong term, i.e. at least around 15 years. The long term Vegetation Indices, which are indicators of crop\nhealth, derived from these satellites can be used to assess the year to year variations and thereby\nunderstanding the risk potential of an area. It can be combined with many other satellite derived\nproducts, such as flood maps, drought assessments and vulnerability and long term weather data to\ncarry out the risk analysis. States are advised to take the support of concerned national or State level\nresearch organizations (e.g. ISRO- NRSC/SAC, MNCFC, SRSC, SAUs, etc.), to use the above mentioned\ntechnology for carrying out risk analysis of the Districts/ Talukas/ Blocks towards improvement in\nclustering.\n3. These are only for guidance of States and States are free to follow either of these or any other method\ndevised by them with intimation to DAC&FW.\n4.

National Crop Insurance Portal for administration of Crop\nInsurance Program (www.pmfby.gov.in)\n36.1 The Govt. is endeavouring to integrate all stakeholders’ viz. farmers, Insurance Companies,\nfinancial institutions and Govt. agencies on single IT platform to ensure better administration,\ncoordination and transparency for getting real time information and monitoring in a phased manner.\n36.2 The idea behind developing a web-based, integrated IT solution is to speed up service delivery, unify\nfragmented databases, achieve a single view of data, eliminate manual processes and thus provide\nfaster insurance services to farmers. DAC&FW has designed a web Portal for crop insurance\n(www.pmfby.gov.in) and is doing further enhancements to provide a single IT enabled platform for\ndigitization of processes and information data bank and dissemination mechanism, automation of\nadministrative procedures, premium and claim calculation and remittance etc. This IT driven system is\nenvisaged to address the issues which affect the current system of programme administration and thereby\nreduce its efficacy and lead to denial/ delay in benefit transfer to farmers viz. selective/layered information\naccess, manual interventions, multi-step procedures, documentary evidence/proofs, delayed/defective\ninformation sharing. Hence, integration of IT platforms of banks, Insurance Companies, State Govts. and\nyield/weather data providers with National Crop Insurance Portal directly or through interface for fetching\nin information is felt essential to avoid errors for timely transmission of requisite information amongst\nmajor stakeholders, early settlement of claims, proper monitoring and transparent administration of the\nSchemes. Once the entire linking of IT platforms of all stakeholders with the Web Portal is established, it\nwould also lead to faster processing of claims due to electronic flow of information. Currently, this Portal is\navailable in two languages – Hindi and English and it will be converted into all regional languages.\n36.3 The aforesaid Portal will provide an integrated ecosystem to streamline the process and to automate\nadministrative functions. A web-based, integrated IT solution has been developed which has opened a\nwindow of opportunity to remote and economically-weak farmers to benefit from crop insurance\nservices.\n36.4 The conceptualisation and development of web-portal has already been completed and launched\nhowever development and integration of futuristic technologies and enhancements as defined below\nare envisaged to be initiated in coming months.\n36.4.1 Payment of Premium and Remittance of Claims through Payment Gateway: All premium remittance\nfrom Farmers/Banks/Intermediaries and claim remittance from Insurance Companies will be routed\nthrough the Portal using payment gateway Pay-Gov.

On the basis of the variation in agriculture output (crops) in each district during the last\n10 years, districts may be divided in to three categories of low, moderate and high risks to agriculture.\nIf variation in agriculture output in the district during the last 10 years worked out to be plus\nminus<15% then district may be categorized as low risk. Similarly, districts of variation ranging plus\nminus 16-30% may be categorized of moderate risks and variation of plus minus >30% as high risks\ndistricts to agriculture operations. Accordingly all districts of the State would be identified as\nlow/moderate/high risk. Number of clusters to be formed shall be decided according to total no. of\ndistricts in the State. Total no. of each category of low, moderate and high risks districts shall be\ndivided by no. of clusters to be formed in the State.

Background and Strategy:\n1.1 SMAE: Erstwhile ‘Sub-Mission on Agricultural Extension (SMAE)’ was being\nimplemented under ‘National Mission on Agricultural Extension & Technology\n(NMAET)’ w.e.f. 2014-15 which has been subsumed as a sub-scheme of Umbrella\nScheme ’Krishonnati Yojana’ from the financial year 2017-18.\nRestructuring and strengthening of agricultural extension machinery has to be a\njudicious mix of extensive physical outreach of personnel, enhancement in quality\nthrough domain experts & regular capacity building, interactive methods of\ninformation dissemination, pervasive & innovative use of Information &\nCommunication Technology (ICT) / Mass Media, Federation of groups and convergence\nof extension related efforts under various schemes and programmes of Government of\nIndia and the State Governments. The objective of this Sub-Mission is to appropriately\nstrengthen, expand and up-scale existing Extension Schemes. The on-going\nExtension Schemes include the ‘Central Sector’ and ‘Centrally Sponsored Schemes’\nbeing implemented by the ‘Extension Division/Directorate of Extension’. Even in the\ncase of Central Sector Schemes which are proposed to be subsumed within the Sub-\nMission, a greater role has been envisaged for the States through their active\ninvolvement in planning, implementation and monitoring. The continuation of SMAE\nbeyond 12th Plan period includes the following components:-\nA. Centrally Sponsored Scheme\nSupport to State Extension Programme for Extension Reforms(ATMA) Scheme.\nB. Central Sector Schemes\n(i). Agri-Clinics & Agri-Business Centre (AC&ABC); (ii) Kisan Call Centre\n(KCC); (iii) Mass Media Scheme in Agricultural Extension (MMSAE) including\nstrengthening of Digital Agriculture Extension Framework; (iv) Diploma in\nAgricultural Extension Services for Input Dealers (DAESI); (v) Extension\nEducation Institutes (EEIs); (vi) National Institute of Agricultural Extension\nManagement (MANAGE) merging NIAM; & (vii) Exhibition/Fairs.\nPage 7 of 122",

    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 9):\n2. Support to State Extension Programme for Extension\nReforms (ATMA Scheme Guidelines)\n2.1 INTRODUCTION: The extension system is an important pillar in\nagricultural development, to empower farmers with relevant information,\ntechnology, skills and support, all of which are necessary to enhance\nsustainability, farmers’ income and agriculture as an enterprise. Agriculture\nprovides ample opportunities for the farmers to undertake several income\ngenerating agri-enterprises which are on-farm, off-farm and non-farm in nature.\nAgri-enterprises include nursery, seed production, custom hiring, vermi-\ncomposting, bee-keeping, managing common storage, processing units, agri-\ntourism, milk chilling unit, mushroom cultivation etc. require skills, investment\nand market linkages. Income addition to farmers through these activities\ncontributes significantly for doubling income not only for the enterprising farmer\nbut also for others who use these quality inputs and services.\nExtension also needs to focus on these areas so as to create the Small-Medium\nEnterprises (SMEs) at Village level. Thus, extension services require re-aligning\nthemselves with Crop Diversification, Integrated Farming System, Climate\nResilient Agriculture, Natural Farming, Market-Led Extension, Risk\nManagement, in both production and marketing for sustainable crop production.\nIn order to increase outreach of extension services to large number of farmers\nand addressing their four common concepts, viz. what to grow?, how to finance?,\nwhat input to use? and where & how to sell?, an urgent need was felt to further\nupscale the existing extension initiatives and revamp the main public extension\nscheme, i.e. Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA).\nNeed for reforms in Agricultural Extension have been explicitly raised in the\nreport of the Committee on “Doubling of Farmers’ Income” (DFI) by 2022.\nKeeping the recommendations of the DFI report and policy initiatives in view and\nto strengthen and make ATMA scheme more vibrant, a futuristic vision has been\ndeveloped to empower the farmers.\n2.2 VISION\nTo empower farmers with information, technology, skill, risk and farm\nmanagement practices across agriculture sub-sectors and commodity specific\nagriculture value chains, so as to enable them to realize higher net income from\ntheir enterprises on a sustainable basis.\nPage 9 of 122",

The Scheme ‘Support to State Extension Programme for Extension Reforms’\npopularly known as ATMA scheme, aimed at promoting decentralized, farmer\nfriendly extension system in the country with an objective to support State\nGovernment’s efforts to revamp the agricultural extension system focusing on\nNatural Farming, Climate Resilient Agriculture, Crop Diversification,\nNational Pest Surveillance System, Soil Health Card, Digital Agriculture\nMission and making available the latest agricultural technologies and good\nagricultural practices to the farmers.\nb. Keeping in view the changed focus of ATMA scheme, the objectives of the\nscheme have been revised as under :-\ni) More emphases of extension services on post-production management,\nsurplus management and marketing.\nii) To converge extension activities of various Divisions of DA&FW in ATMA\nCafeteria.\niii) Convergence between research and extension.\niv) Extension outreach to farmers through Video Conferencing.\nv) Skill Development Training of Rural Youth (minimum 200 hours).\nvi) To promote climate resilient agriculture, according to requirement of various\nagro-climatic zone.\nvii) Adopting group approach to extension in line with the identified needs and\nrequirements of the farmers in the form of CIGs/FIGs/FSGs and consolidate\nthem as FPOs.\nviii) Addressing gender concerns by mobilizing women farmers into groups for\ntheir capacity building\nix) Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) based farmers training.\n2.4 CHANGES IN THE EXISTING ATMA SCHEME\nIn order to accomplish the vision, guiding elements of DFI report and key\nobjectives/reforms, the following changes have been made in the Scheme:-\n2.4.1 Production to Market Orientation:\nFocus of extension services will be given on marketing aspects along with a\nquality production. Farmers training shall be organized on the themes of\nPost-Harvest Management, Surplus Management, Agriculture Marketing,\nvarious initiatives of Government, etc. For ensuring implementation of\nactivities with changed focus towards marketing, States may take up the\nfollowing steps:-\ni. All extension personnel (ATMA & Non-ATMA) are targeted to be trained in\nmarket led extension training programmes. The training modules on market\nled extension for field functionaries and farmers have been developed which\nmay be seen in Annexure-VI & Annexure-VII respectively.\nPage 10 of 122",
    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 11):\nii. Farmers training programmes (within District) under the scheme henceforth\nshall be two days duration. Training module shall include RPL based farmers\ntraining followed by their up-skilling. A certificate of progressive farmers will\nbe provided to them on successful completion of the training programme.\nSuch farmers’ trainings shall be organized at the level of Gram Panchayats.\nIn special cases, States may also organize such trainings at Block level at a\nlarger scale. The certified progressive farmers are expected to disseminate\nacquired knowledge and skill among their fellow farmers. The concept of RPL\nmay be seen at Annexure-XII.\n2.5. Converge Extension Activities of various Divisions of Department of\nAgriculture & Farmers’ Welfare (DA&FW) in ATMA Cafeteria:\nExtension activities of various Divisions of DA&FW have been identified and\nmade these eligible to converge in ATMA cafeteria. These identified thematic\nareas include Post-Harvest Management, Surplus Management, Marketing,\nDiversification, Integrated Farming System, Seed Production& Seed Technology,\nIntegrated Development of Horticulture, Soil Health Management, Integrated\nPest Management, Agricultural Mechanization, Micro Irrigation, etc. Duration\nand cost norms along with certification may be as per specified guidelines of\nrespective schemes of various Divisions of DA&FW.\n2.6 Convergence of Extension with Ministry of Rural Development and Ministry\nof Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying:\nServices of Krishi Sakhis & Pashu Sakhis nurtured by DAY-NRLM may be\nsuitably used for creating awareness among the farmers under ATMA Scheme\nafter providing them training in relevant subjects.\n2.7 Convergence between Research and Extension:\nIn order to implement convergence circular jointly signed by the DG, ICAR &\nthe Secretary (AC&FW) in letter and spirit, a convergence matrix has been\nprepared for reporting/monitoring with quantifiable targets as per details given\nbelow :-\na. Monthly Interface Meeting\nb. Pre-seasonal Technical Updation\nc. Farmer-Scientist Interactions at District level\nd. Designating Experts at District level for instant technical help of ATM/BTM\ne. Joint Visits in identified villages by ATMA and KVK\nf. Reporting and Monitoring mechanism.\nStates may ensure regular implementation and reporting of progress on\nconvergence between research and extension on the above matrix. The detailed\nguidelines regarding convergence may be seen in the Chapter No. IV.\nPage 11 of 122",

This component was earlier\nimplemented from RKVY funding and skill trainings were conducted through\nKrishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs). As per revised Guidelines, the District ATMA to\nimplement this component in consultation with respective KVK.\n2.10 Promotion of Innovative ATMA set-up based on Agro-Ecological Zones:\nIn order to improve mechanism of agricultural extension system in the\ncountry, States may consider various innovative and flexible ideas like\norganising ATMA activities agro-ecological zones in a district. States may\nconsider such innovative ideas based on the agro-ecological zones in each\ndistrict prescribing farmers to adopt appropriate technologies and cropping\npatterns. Manpower support under the scheme, however, shall not exceed\nthe maximum permissible limit, based on the number of administrative\ndistricts in State.\nIII. ATMA Set-up & Human Resource (HR)\n3.1 ATMA set-up at different levels is given below:-\n3.1.1 State Level\n(i) The State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) set up under Rashtriya Krishi\nVikas Yojana (RKVY) is the apex body to approve State Extension Work Plan\n(SEWP) which will form a part of the State Agriculture Plan (SAP). In those cases\nwhere SLSC meeting cannot be held in time or there is any other administrative\nreason, SEWP can be approved by the Executive Committee of SMAE on the\nrecommendation of Inter Departmental Working Group (IDWG).\n(ii) The SLSC may be supported by the IDWG which is responsible for day-to-day\ncoordination and management of the Scheme activities within the State.\nPage 12 of 122",

The SNC will then convey the approval and\nmonitor implementation of these work plans by State Agricultural Management\n& Extension Training Institutes (SAMETIs) and ATMAs. The SAMETIs will draw-\nup and execute an Annual Training Calendar for capacity building of the\nExtension Functionaries in the State. While doing so, the SAMETI will check\nduplication and overlapping of training content, training schedule, and trainees\nthemselves. The SAMETIs table to ensure effective coordination with MANAGE,\nHyderabad for finalizing the Annual Training Calendar through their\nparticipation and indepth discussion in the National annual Training Planning\nWorkshop at MANAGE involving all the stakeholders.\n3.1.2 District Level\nATMA is an autonomous institution set up at district level to ensure delivery of\nextension services to farmers. ATMA Governing Board is the apex body of\nATMA which provides overall policy direction. ATMA Management Committee\nis the executive body looking after implementation of the scheme. District\nFarmers Advisory Committee is a body to provide farmers’ feedback for district\nlevel planning and implementation. With dedicated staff provided for the ATMA,\nit will continue to be the district level nodal agency responsible for overall\nmanagement of agriculture extension system within the district, including\npreparation of Strategic Research and Extension Plan (SREP). The process flow\nfor formulating Action Plans has been described in Para 3.2 below.\n3.1.3 Block Level\nThe Block ATMA Cell consisting of Block Technology Team (BTT) (a team\ncomprising officers of agriculture and other allied departments within the\nblock) and Block Farmers’ Advisory Committee (BFAC) (a group exclusively\nconsisting of selected farmers of the block) will prepare the Block Action Plan\n(BAP) and provide necessary extension support within the Block in its\nexecution.\n3.1.4. Village Level\n(i) The Farmer Friend (FF) will serve as a vital link between extension system and\nfarmers at village level (one for every two villages).\n(ii) Agri-entrepreneurs, Diploma holders in Agricultural Extension Services for\nInput Dealers (DAESI), Input Dealers and extension workers in non-\nPage 13 of 122",

Process Flow for Action Plans\nSREP is a comprehensive document identifying research/extension priorities of\nthe district, keeping in mind agro-ecological situations and existing gaps in\ntechnology generation & dissemination in all agriculture and allied sector\nareas/activities including Horticulture, Animal Husbandry, Dairying &\nFisheries. All extension related activities under other schemes of DA&FW\nwould naturally form part of SREP. SREPs will be prepared in coordination\nwith the line departments, NGOs, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), Panchayati\nRaj Institutions (PRIs), Private Sector, farmers and other stakeholders at the\ndistrict level.\nSimilar training & field extension related components in other programmes of\nDA&FW and State Governments will also be implemented through ATMA.\nFunds earmarked for such activities under different Schemes/ Programmes\nwill be utilized through ATMA. Similarly, ATMA funds also will be suitably\nused to cover training & field extension objectives/activities of other Schemes/\nProgrammes. Such convergence arrived at through SREP/ SEWP will avoid\nduplication and ensure wider coverage in terms of outreach to farmers and\ngamut of activities.\nVarious Action Plans shall emanate from SREP as follows:\n(i) These SREPs are Five-year vision documents which shall be revisited after every\n5 years to accommodate newly identified gaps and emerging areas of\nimportance viz. market plan based on cross-sector value chain approach,\nskill development, agri start-ups and off-farm income generating options.\n(ii) SREPs will form the basis for formulation of Block Action Plans (BAPs) on an\nannual basis. Block Action Plans are then consolidated at the District level to\nprepare the District Agriculture Action Plans (DAAPs).\n(iii) The DAAPs will be consolidated in the form of State Extension Work Plan\n(SEWP) which then forms a part of consolidated Annual Action Plan (AAP)\nunder KY.\n3.3. ATMA Human Resource provided at different levels is given below:\nFor ensuring effective implementation of the scheme at the grass root level and\naddressing the need of the farmers, provision of a robust and dedicated\nspecialist and extension functionaries has been made in the scheme.

For example : in case\na Computer Programmer (CP) deployed in 2014 with the existing monthly\nremuneration @ Rs.16,000/- (fixed in 2014) is presently getting gross\nmonthly emoluments more than revised initial ceiling of Rs.25,000/-, he /\nshe will be eligible for getting an annual increase @ upto 5% (flat and not\ncompounding) while a CP who is presently getting only say Rs.18,000/-\nper month ( i.e. less than the revised initial ceiling ) will be eligible for\ngetting an annual increase @ upto 10% (flat and not compounding), till\nhe/she reaches up to the revised initial ceiling.\nNote:\na) Higher amounts to existing contractual/outsourced manpower are payable\nonly after performance review and screening on the lines described above.\nWhile fixing total emoluments to contractual/outsourced manpower of any\npost at enhanced rate, emoluments should not be less than total\nemoluments last paid to contractual/outsourced manpower.\nb) The amounts listed above are upper ceilings ‘for initial fixation of\nemolument’ and the State Governments may consider fixing the\nemoluments accordingly.\n(iv) If, for reasons to be recorded in writing, the candidates for various posts\nwith prescribed qualifications as given at Annexure-IV(c) are not available,\nthe qualifications may be relaxed by the IDWG subject to ratification by the\nSLSC under intimation to the Government of India.\n(v) Leave/maternity leave etc. to contractual/outsourced ATMA manpower may\nbe considered by the States/UTs at par with similarly placed contractual /\noutsourced manpower in other organizations in the State/UT concerned.\n3.4.6 Support for Innovative Activity at Village Level (Farmer Friend)\n(i) It is necessary to identify and groom progressive farmers (including\nwomen farmers) with requisite qualification (Senior Secondary/High\nSchool) & experience as Farmer Friend (FF), one per two census\nvillages. In case of non-availability of progressive farmers with\nrequisite qualifications, at some places, a progressive farmer, with\nPage 20 of 122",
    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 21):\nrequired oral and written communication skills, may be considered.\nOnly experienced and achiever farmers (say, with an age of more than\n40 years or so, as the State Government may deem appropriate) are\nto be designated as Farmer Friends. Preference may be given to\nawardee/progressive farmers while identifying farmer friend. Farmer\nFriend will lead by example and is expected to have up-graded skills and\nwould be available in the village to advice on agriculture and allied\nactivities. Since FFs provide a vital link between public extension system\nand farmers at village level, it is essential to select experienced,\nprogressive and practicing farmers who are not looking forward to this\ntask as an alternative means of livelihood. The Farmer Friend will be\nidentified by BTM on a resolution of Gram Panchayat (GP), which will, in\nturn, consult CIGs/FIGs working in the Panchayat area.\n(ii) Farmer Friends will be provided with special opportunity for upgradation\nof skills through trainings, study tours and visits to SAUs/other\ninstitutes, by utilizing support available under ATMA. Rs.18,000/- per\nFarmer Friend per year will be shared between the Centre and the State\nas per pattern of assistance approved for all other activities under the\nscheme to meet contingency expenditure which FF incurs towards\ndischarge of his duties, including incidental expenses incurred on\nacquisition of knowledge. It should not be perceived as remuneration. It\nis to clarify that identification of Farmer friends should not be seen as\nan employment opportunity in the State Government and this was never\nenvisaged under the scheme.\nIV. CAFETERIA OF ACTIVITIES\nATMA CAFETERIA OF ACTIVITIES:\nIn order to implement extension activities with special focus on post-harvest\nmanagement, marketing, etc. as recommended by the Committee on “Doubling\nof Farmers’ Income (DFI) by 2022, various extension activities are to be carried\nout at different levels addressing national priority areas (Annexure-I) suitably\ncontributing in the national goal of doubling of farmers’ income. Extension\nservices are being re-aligned with sustainability aspects of farming, for crop\ndiversification, integrated farming system, climate resilient agriculture, risk\nmanagement, Natural Farming in both production and marketing.\nAdditional/innovative extension activities have included to be implemented\nunder ATMA scheme, viz. extension through interaction etc., at\nPanchayat/Village level for providing door-step services and dissemination of\ninformation on Government schemes to farmers.\nPage 21 of 122",

This\ndocument is prepared adopting integrated farming system approach,\nwhere extension and research gaps of all the sub-systems are identified\nthrough participatory methods. SREP is re-visited after every five years to\naccommodate newly identified gaps and emerging areas. The committee\non DFI has since recommended paradigm shift from production to\nmarket-led-extension, States may include new areas in revised SREP like\nmarket-led-extension,mitigate crop loses, Skill Development, agri-start-\nups and income generating livelihood options.\nB.2 Farmers Training:\nFarmers Training is an important component of capacity building of\nfarmers in latest agriculture technologies and adoption of Good\nAgricultural Practices (GAPs). Farmers Training would focus on thrust\nareas like Natural Farming, Climate Resilient Agriculture, Crop\nDiversification, National Pest Surveillance System, Soil Health Card,\nDigital Agriculture Mission etc. In order to maintain quality of farmers\ntraining, farmers training shall be conducted in the specialized subject\nmatter institutions viz: ICAR Institutes/ State Agriculture\nUniversities/State Agricultural Management & Training Institutes/\nMANAGE/ EEIs and KVKs etc. [Annexure-V(a)].\ni.

Duration of the farmers training for inter-state, intra-State shall be 7days\n& 5 days respectively, excluding journey time. Farmers training\nprogrammes (within District) under the scheme would be 2 days duration\nand these shall be organized at the level of Gram Panchayats. In special\ncases, States may also organize such trainings at Block level at a larger\nscale.\niv. Beneficiary farmers should be selected in a transparent manner such that\nall panchayats in a block are covered on rotation basis. Repetition of\nfarmers is not permissible, except when theme of training is different.\nOther guidelines regarding selection of beneficiaries may be referred in\nChapter-VII.\nv. States shall develop module for these farmers training in consultation\nwith domain experts. Training module shall include recognizing the Prior\nlearning of farmers followed by their up-skilling by way of training. A\ncertificate of progressive farmers will be provided to them on successful\ncompletion of the training programme. The certified progressive farmers\nare expected to disseminate acquired knowledge and skill among their\nfellow farmers.\nFarmer Trainings may be organized by ATMA through respective domain\nexperts of ICAR/KVKs, SAUs, National/State level Institutes, Government\nagencies and specialized Institutes etc.\nvi. The identified thematic areas of farmers training include:\nNational Priority Areas/Themes:-\n(i) Post-harvest management\n(ii) Organic production clusters\n(iii) Market led extension\n(iv) Seed production and seed technology aspects\n(v) Integrated farming, climate resilient cropping system, adaptation and good\nagricultural practices.\n(vi) Integrated pest management practices in major crops\n(vii) Holistic growth of Horticulture sector covering fruits, vegetables, root and\ntuber crops, mushrooms, spices, flowers, aromatic plants, coconut, cocoa\nand bamboo.\n(viii) Judicious use of chemical fertilizers based on the recommendations of Soil\nHealth Card\n(ix) Promotion of oilseeds cultivation\nPage 24 of 122",

Demonstration with an embedded philosophy of ‘seeing is believing’ is an\nimportant extension activity to teach new knowledge and skills to farmers.\nDemonstration shall be organized in those areas which have not been\ncovered under other Schemes / Missions / Sub-Missions of the Ministry of\nAgriculture & Farmer’s Welfare. ‘Notified varieties for climate resilient\nagriculture and bio-fortified varieties’ of different crops would be\npromoted through these extension activities. Appropriate publicity should\nbe accorded to the Demonstration and Farm Schools so that benefits can\nreach to the large number of farmers. A provision of Rs.6,000/- per acre is\nmade under the scheme for one demo (Photographs of the event will be\nuploaded on Krishi Mapper). This provision shall be used for soil testing ,\nseeds of improved variety of crops, fertilizer, IPM, display board etc. Selected\nfarmer may also organize a controlled plot demonstration of 1 acre at his\nown cost, so that a comparison can be drawn. Soil Testing /Soil Health\nCard is mandatory for conducting Demonstration.\nii. Demonstration shall be organized in a plot of 1 acre land, at place easily\napproachable/accessible to other farmers. There should be a prominent\ndisplay board at the selected plot indicating the details of demonstration\nactivity.\niii. Beneficiary farmers should be selected in a transparent manner such that\nall panchayats in a block are covered on rotation basis. Repetition of\nPage 25 of 122",
    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 26):\nfarmers is not permissible, except when crop of demonstration is different.\nOther guidelines regarding selection of beneficiaries may be referred in\nChapter-IX.\niv. For wider dissemination and increased outreach, State is expected to\nsuitably popularize the demonstration activity among the targeted farmers.\nState may use various modes of publicity for reaching large number of\nfarmers.\nB.4 Exposure Visits of Farmers:\nThe exposure visits of farmers to exemplary farms either inter-state, within\nstate and within district are considered as the best form of learning from\nnew farming practices and modern, scientific and innovative farm\ntechnologies. Exposure visits of farmers will be conducted in national /\ninternational/ regional/ state and district level Agri-Fairs wherein\nadvanced agriculture technologies are show-cased for creating awareness\namong large number of farmers.Travel and staying together with fellow\nfarmers affords more time and is a good opportunity to share each other’s\nexperiences and establish rapport, which can result in actual adoption.\nThe cost norms for inter-state, within state and within district exposure\nvisits for farmers of General/NER States per manday are indicated in\ncafeteria table.\nB.5 Mobilization of Farmer Interest Groups (FIGs):\nGroup approach is central to the restructured extension mechanism to\nmake extension more demand-driven. ATMA is envisaged as a very\neffective instrument for promoting participatory planning and group based\napproaches with focus on learning and empowerment. The aim is to\nredirect extension activities towards diversification into high value crops\nand products thereby increasing farm income and rural employment. With\nthis market-driven approach to extension, it was envisaged that the ATMA\nbody will make efforts to promote group of farmers and organize them\naround specific crops for commodities. These village level FIGs/CIGs are\nto be ultimately federated at Block/District level such as Block Level\nFarmers’ Association, District Level Farm Federations, etc. so as to make\nthe technology generation/dissemination farmer-driven and farmer-\naccountable. A provision of Rs.10,000/- per FIG has been provided for\nmobilization of 1 group of 20 farmers and Rs.25,000/- as seed money\n(revolving fund) for viable FIG/CIG. There is a capping of 20 groups per\nPage 26 of 122",
    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 27):\nblock per year. FIGs/CIGs/FSGs are required to be federated as Farmers\nProducers Organizations (FPOs).\nWomen Food Security Groups (B.5.c):\nRural women play a very important role in agriculture. As such, it is\nproposed that ATMA should lay focus and address women’s’ issues\nthrough special interventions. To ensure food and nutritional security at\nthe household level, it is proposed to support promotion of Farm women’s\nFood Security Groups (FSGs). These FSGs would be provided support for\ntraining, publication and access to inputs @ Rs.25,000/- per group. It is\nproposed that minimum 2 FSGs per Block per year is mandated under the\nscheme. These FSGs would serve as “Model Food Security Hubs” through\nestablishing kitchen garden, backyard poultry, goatery, animal husbandry\n& dairying, mushroom cultivation, etc. These groups would essentially be\nprovided input support including small tools, seeds, planting material for\nsetting up backyard food security garden @ Rs.25,000/- per group.\nB.6 Farmer Awards:\nTo incentivize best farmers representing different enterprises, a provision\nof Rs.10,000/- per farmer per year has been made. State may device a\ntransparent mechanism to select the best farmers in relevant enterprise\ninvolving technical and scientific agencies. In identifying potential\nawardees, preference may be given to the farmers recognized for their\nproduction/productivity or progressive farmers recognized for their\ninnovative farming practices. These individuals may be actively involved at\nblock or village-level activities such as Farm Schools and other local\nagricultural initiatives, contributing to the community's development and\nknowledge sharing.\nB.7 to B.9 Farm Information Dissemination through exhibitions, Mass\nMedia, publication:\nThis includes local level agricultural exhibitions, low cost publications,\ninformation dissemination through printed materials and development of\ntechnology packages in electronic form. The cost norms of these activities\nmay be seen in Annexure-V(a).\nB.10 to B.12 Agriculture Technology Refinement, Validation and Adoption\nThis includes to designate expert for each District from the Scientists of\nKVKs/SAUs, organization of Farmer-Scientist Interaction at local level,\njoint visits by scientist and extension personnel for which substantial\nfinancial provision has been made in the cafeteria, organization of Field-\ndays and Kisan Goshthies and assessment, refinement, validation &\nadoption for frontline technologies and other short term researchable\nPage 27 of 122",
    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 28):\nissues through KVKs and other local research centres. Cost norms of\nthese activities are clearly indicated in the cafeteria. While designating\nDistrict level experts from KVKs/SAUs, only those Scientists may be\nconsidered who have already participated in carrying out Farmers-\nScientists-Interaction (FSIs) activity. Farmer Friend (FF) and Agri-Advisors\n(AAs) should also be involved actively in FSIs.\nB.13 Administrative expenses:- As per details given in cafeteria.\nB.14 Farm Schools :-\n(i)An important means to upgrade the process of dissemination of\ninformation in agriculture and allied sector is farmer-to-farmer approach,\nwhich is found to be very pertinent. The key feature of the Farm Schools\nbeing promoted under ATMA is that at least three Farm Schools to be set\nup in each Block in the field of outstanding or achiever farmers. Farm\nSchools and Farm School Trainers for each season would be finally\napproved by the ATMA GB; main activities of Farm Schools would be to\noperationalize frontline demonstrations in one hectare land in one or more\ncrops/allied sector activities. Farm Schools would provide season long\ntechnical backstroking/training to target farmers by having an interactive\nsession one at least during each of the four critical stages in a cropping\nseason. 50% representation may be given to small and marginal farmers\nwhile selecting the trainees of the Farm Schools. Now, Farm Schools (FS)\nwill be organized in two models viz: Model I- at Progressive Farmer's\nfield @ Rs.32,400/FS and Model-II - at Awardee farmer's field @\nRs.20,200/FS. Number of Critical stages have been reduced from existing\nSix to Four stages namely (i) Crown Root Initiation, (ii) Tillering, (iii)\nFlowering and (iv) Milk & Dough stage.\n(ii) The detailed concept of Farm School and item-wise cost norms may be\nseen in Annexure-V(b).\nB.15 Farmer Friend:\nThe Farmer Friend (FF) will serve as a vital link between extension system\nand farmers at village level (one for every two villages). An amount of\nRs.18,000/- per annum is payable to a farmer friend as a contingency\namount.\nPage 28 of 122",
    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 29):\nC Innovative Activities:\nIn order to encourage States for taking up innovative work in extension, it\nis proposed to provide Rs.25.00 lakh at State level and at District level @\nRs.0.50 lakh per block. For taking up innovative activities at State and\nDistrict level, approval/rectification in the IDWG meeting would be\nrequired. Various innovative activities include:\nC.1 PG Diploma in Agricultural Extension Management or\nAgricultural Marketing Management :-\nPGDAEM or PGDAMM for in-service extension functionaries\ncontinue to be implemented through MANAGE/NIAM releasing\ncentral share directly to MANAGE.\nC.2 Innovative Activities-State level\nC.3 Innovative Activities-District level\nC.4 SETTING UP OF COMMUNITY RADIO STATIONS (CRSs)\ni. Community Radio Stations (CRS) have to be promoted in a big way to\nexpand the reach of localised technologies to the farmers located within a\nradius of 20 to 50 Kilometers.\nii. A total amount of not more than Rs.65 lakh (including capital and\nrecurring cost) is proposed to be provided as assistance for CRS spread over\noperational period.There will be a ceiling of Rs.14.50 lakh on the capital cost\nbut the same can be reviewed if substantially higher range than the present\nstandard of 20 Kms. radius is proposed to be covered. Support for content\ncreation at a rate not exceeding Rs.3,500/-per hour normally with a\ndiminishing support structure of 730,540 and 200 hours respectively for first,\nsecond and third year will be provided. Some NGOs and KVKs may also use\ninnovative technologies meeting minimum system requirement or contribution\nfrom some private players to reduce the capital cost. Subject to compliance of\nminimum technical specification for setting up of Community Radio Station,\nbreak-up of Rs.65.00 lakh is permitted to be changed from capital cost to\nrecurring cost or recurring cost from one year to another. If cost of production\ncan be reduced without diluting quality norms or there is some other financial\nsupport like advertisement, revenue or part of capital cost is diverted to\nrecurring expenditure or a time lag between setting-up of CRS and start of\nPage 29 of 122",
    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 30):\nprogrammes, recurring cost also can be taken to even beyond three years\nsubject to overall cost ceiling. Further, year-wise cost ceilings per CRS have\nbeen given in the Cafeteria of Activities (D.2)\niii. Funding to private institutions along with Government and Quasi-\ngovernment organizations for setting up Community Radio Stations (CRSs) can\nbe considered.\niv. Community based organizations, Agencies/NGOs registered under\nSocieties Registration Act, 1860 or any other such Act and recognized by the\nCentral Government/State Government and serving in Agriculture and allied\nareas including SAUs and/KVKs are eligible for funding. Registration at the\ntime of application should be at least three years old.\nv. The willing Organizations should have basic infrastructure and facilities\nin the form of a room of about 400 sq. feet/ electricity/ necessary manpower to\nrun and operate the CRSs.\nvi. ATMA MC of the District concerned may select suitable proposal/s;\nrecommend them to the Nodal Officer/Commissioner of Agriculture of the\nconcerned State for onward transmission to DAC through the competent\ncommittee, i.e., the IDWG having representation of SAU/ICAR Institutes/KVKs\nconcerned so that the proposals are not referred again to ICAR by I&B Ministry\nwhich causes a considerable delay in granting approvals.\nvii. The PD, ATMA would regularly review the performance of CRSs along with\nother activities with the BTMs. In addition, ATMA GB would review the\nperformance in detail with regard to content creation, involvement of local\ncommunity, suitability to local conditions, release/utilization of funds for/by\nCRS and convergence & synergy with SAU/KVKs.\nviii. Any organization already sought CRS funding for 3 years will not be\neligible for funding again under the Scheme.\nD Manpower Support\nDetails are given in chapter-III of this Guidelines and initial monthly\nremuneration rates mentioned in Activity D of ATMA Cafeteria,2025.\nPage 30 of 122",

ATMA Cafeteria\nprovides for Farmer Scientist interaction for a group of 25 farmers for 2\ndays @Rs.30,000/- per interaction. At least 3 such interactions, one\nbefore each crop season per year may be organised in each district with\nactive involvement of local KVK, SAU Scientists and PD, ATMA of the\ndistrict.\nB11(b) Joint Visits by Scientists and Extension Functionaries:\nJoint visits by the PD ATMA/Extension workers at the district level\nKVK/SAU/ICAR scientists greatly helps in creating a common\nunderstanding of field level technological issues and providing an\nintegrated solution to the problems faced by the farmers. In order to\nensure proper mobility for field visits of the scientists accompanied by\nextension workers, funds have been provided under ATMA cafeteria for\nmeeting the expenditure towards hiring of vehicles or POL @Rs.2,000/-\nper visit per district.\nA.9 Extension through Interaction :\nIn order to provide greater opportunities of interaction between farmers and\nexperts on regular basis, a mechanism through constitution of expert\ncommittees is proposed at State and National levels with involvement of\ndomain experts of Agriculture, Horticulture, Animal Husbandry, Dairying,\nFisheries, Veterinary, Sericulture and Agricultural Marketing, weather &\nmeteorology etc. including those from banking and insurance sector.\nFor answering farmer’s queries and to resolve their problems from a single\nplatform on a regular basis, it is proposed to put in place two Committees viz.\nState Level Expert Committee and Central Level Expert Committee. The State\nLevel Expert Committee (SLEC) is proposed to interact with farmers of the\nState through Video Conferencing on quarterly basis. It is proposed to collect,\ncollate and prioritize farmers queries related to agriculture and all allied\nsectors across complete value chain i.e. from production to marketing,\nincluding other critical areas such as soil health, water use\nefficiency,waste/residue management etc. from all Blocks/Districts of a State\nusing ATMA network. All important District Level queries are proposed to be\ndocumented at the level of State Nodal Cell (SNC). SNC is responsible to\ncoordinate and implement interaction between farmers and scientists on\nregular basis through video conferencing. The cost norms for this activity are\ngiven at A.9 of the cafeteria.\nThe mechanism for Video Conferencing would be as under:-\nPage 31 of 122",

    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 35):\nV. Convergence between Agricultural\nResearch and Extension\n5. With a view to improve farm income and livelihood security of the farming\nhouseholds, the Government has been implementing number of programmes under\nvarious Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored schemes through the Ministry of\nAgriculture and Farmers Welfare. This can be facilitated to a great extent through a\ndemand driven technology development and its transfer to farmers in an effective way\nwith a focus on ensuring convergence of efforts at different levels for rendering an\nintegrated service delivery to the farmers. In particular, the linkages between National\nAgriculture Research System (NARS) and extension machinery at cutting edge level\nneed to be strengthened.\n5.1 While the concept of district level Agricultural Technology Management Agency\n(ATMA) has been promoted with an idea to provide a platform for integrated\nextension delivery involving all the stakeholders, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs)\noperating at the same level act as an outreach arm of National Agricultural\nResearch System (NARS) facilitating validation and adoption of new technologies\nthrough frontline demonstrations, training & awareness programmes and other\ninitiatives.\n5.2 A detailed circular on research-extension convergence was last issued on 17th\nJune, 2015 under joint signatures of Secretary, Department of Agriculture,\nCooperation & Farmers Welfare and Secretary, Department of Agricultural\nResearch & Education & DG, ICAR indicating agreed and actionable points for both\nextension system in the State (represented by ATMA) and the NARS (represented by\nthe State Agricultural Universities, ICAR Research Institutes and KVKs at the\ncutting edge level. There has been varying levels of progress in implementation of\nthese guidelines across the States. The situation has been reviewed in light of\noperational concerns expressed by different stakeholders in implementation of\nthese guidelines and recent developments at policy and operational front which\nrequire reiterating salient points of the earlier circular apart from new initiatives.\n5.3 In order to ensure that the technology development for grass root level is\ndemand driven and captures the critical gaps existing at technology and extension\nfront, the farmers are able to gain desired benefits out of these interventions .The\naction points which have been agreed between the two departments are elaborated\nin the following paras :-\n5.4 All the steps as laid down in the revised ATMA Guidelines to ensure better\nconvergence between research and extension will be considered to utilize the built-\nin provisions under the ATMA Cafeteria.\ni. Farmer Scientist Interactions (FSI) at District level: Farmer Scientist\ninteractions at district level provide a platform for addressing farmers’\nconcerns on new technologies developed by research institutes and help\nin bringing forth various technological options for the coming season\nPage 35 of 122",

ATMA Cafeteria provides for\nFarmer Scientist interaction for a group of 25 farmers for 2 days\n@Rs.30,000/- per interaction. At least 2 such interactions, one before\neach crop season per year may be organized in each district with active\ninvolvement of local KVK and SAU Scientists and PD, ATMA of the\ndistrict.\nii. The SAU may designate an expert who would be in-charge of one\nDistrict to provide instant guidance to extension functionaries in the\nDistrict. He/she will work in tandem with District Head of Agriculture\nand Allied Departments, Project Director ATMA and Programme\nCoordinator, KVK. A fixed amount of Rs.3000/- per month per district\nhas been provided to meet expert honorarium of these officials related\nto returning calls of the farmers and other stakeholders that they may\nreceive. IDWG may decide on break-up of the amount among four such\nofficers as above in every district after considering mobile phone\nexpenses already being reimbursed by the State Government and other\norganisations concerned and actual comparative necessity.\niii. Joint Visits by Scientists and Extension Functionaries: Joint visits by\nthe PD ATMA/Extension workers at the district level KVK/SAU/ICAR\nscientists greatly helps in creating a common understanding of field\nlevel technological issues and providing an integrated solution to the\nproblems faced by the farmers. In order to ensure proper mobility for\nfield visits of the scientists accompanied by extension workers, funds\nhave been provided under ATMA cafeteria for meeting the expenditure\ntowards hiring of vehicles or POL @Rs.2,000/-per visit per district.\niv. Organization of Kisan Goshthies: To strengthen Research – Extension –\nFarmer linkages 1 Kisan Goshthi per block in each of the 2 seasons is\nenvisaged in the ATMA cafeteria. KVK and SAU Scientists may plan the\nsame with PD, ATMA and actively participate in the said event. Cost\nnorm revised to Rs. 25000 per programme.\nv.

    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 37):\ni.e. before the start of Kharif and Rabi crop seasons to the ATMA for its\nwider dissemination among the farmers of the district.\nvii. Interface meeting: Programme Coordinators of the KVKs in the District\nbesides participating in the ATMA Governing Board should also have an\ninterface meeting with the Project Director, ATMA once a month during\nthe cropping season and work out a strategy of providing crop\nadvisories to farmers for various stages of crop growth. Scientists\navailable in the KVKs will advise and mentor Block Technology Teams\nin identifying technological needs in various Blocks in the District and\nprogrammatic interventions to meet such needs.\nviii. Conduct of Field Days, Kisan Melas and Goshthies: ATMA and KVK\nshould coordinate with each other in the conduct of Field Days, Kisan\nMelas, Goshthies and setting up of Farm Schools, so that there is no\nduplication in coverage and they should ensure percolation of\nappropriate scientific practices down to the field level.\nix. Release of Fund to KVKs: Funds for KVK activities under ATMA\nprogramme will be released directly to KVKs under intimation to\nrespective controlling authorities i.e. Director Extension Education\n(DEE) & Comptroller and Directors of ICAR Institute in case of KVKs\nrun by Agricultural Universities and ICAR institutes respectively. For\nthe KVKs run by NGOs, funds will be released directly to KVKs under\nintimation to Zonal Project Directors of the zone concerned. Utilisation\nCertificates for the funds released by ATMA will be provided by the\nKVKs only. However, the respective host organisations and monitoring\nauthorities (i.e. Agricultural Universities, ICAR institutes and Zonal\nProject Directors) will continue to supervise all activities of KVKs\nincluding the ones related to ATMA.\nx. Documentation of Researchable Issues: The long term researchable\nissues may be documented, agro-climatic zone-wise with the\ninvolvement of Zonal Agricultural Research Stations (ZARS). These\nissues will be formally communicated to the concerned ZARS through\nthe respective SAUs with the approval of the Inter- Departmental\nWorking Group (IDWG). The IDWG having Vice- Chancellor/s of SAUs\nas well as Director(s) of ICAR institutes in the State as its members will\nreview the progress of research work taken up by the ZARSs on such\nissues.\nxi. Implementation of Flagship Programmes: KVKs will provide advice to\nATMA and the District Administration for the implementation of\nFlagship programmes of the DA&FW covered under– RKVY and\nKrishonnati Yojana. The KVK Scientists will technically advise the Block\nTechnology Teams (BTTs) and will also be actively involved in\nPage 37 of 122",
    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 38):\npreparation of Block Action Plans (BAPs), especially with regard to\nresearch related issues/gaps and strategies. Regular participation of a\nKVK scientist in the meetings of Block Technology Teams will be\nensured at least once in a quarter. The participating scientist will also\ntake feedback for his colleagues in the KVK in respect of their respective\nareas of expertise.\nxii. Involvement of SAUs/KVKs in Training and capacity building of\nExtension Functionaries under ATMA and Kisan Call Centres: The\nSAUs and KVKs act as a repository of technologies in agriculture and\nallied sector suited to specific local situations. Their active involvement\nin organizing orientation and refresher training programmes for these\nfunctionaries would greatly help them updating their technological\nknowledge for a better extension delivery.\nxiii. Data Entry of Demonstrations by KVKs and SAUs: Data on\ndemonstrations being organised by district ATMAs for agriculture and\nallied sectors (including diversification from one sector to another) is\nbeing entered in the Extension Reforms Monitoring System (ERMS)\n(https://extensionreforms.dacnet.nic.in). The details of the same can be\nfetched from ERMS as well as from the Farmers’ Portal clicking at the\nlink provided therein. However, some very useful and effective\ndemonstrations carried out by SAUs / KVKs etc. have not been entered\nand thus not made part of the drillable database at the link given in the\nFarmers’ Portal. State Agricultural Universities (including Horticultural,\nVeterinary and Fisheries), Zonal Project Directors and KVKs to start\ndoing data entry on the ERMS interface, so that farmers can know\nabout the demonstrations of their interest that are taking place in their\narea and a scientific analysis of efficacy of various agricultural\npractices, new technologies, varieties of seeds/species etc. can be\ncarried out.\nxiv. Use of mKisan Portal for Sending Text and Voice Based Advisories to\nFarmers: The mKisan Portal launched by the DA&FW provides a very\nuseful interface for sending text and voice based advisories to Farmers.\nScientist working in ICAR Headquarters, Zonal Project Directors,\nResearch Institutes, & AICRPs, SAUS and KVKs may register as users\nin the portal and keep sending useful and need based advisories to\ntargeted farmers using the mKisan interface. Feedback may be taken\nfrom farmers during Field Visits about usefulness of advisories.\nxv. Involvement of Scientists from ICAR Institutes, SAUs and KVKs in\nproviding Technical Backstopping to the Kisan Call Centres (KCCs):\nThe scientists from ICAR Institutes, SAUs and KVKs may be nominated\nto act as Call Conferencing experts with the Kisan Call Centres\nPage 38 of 122",
    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 39):\noperating in respective States to answer the query of farmers which the\nFarm Tele Advisors (FTAs) at the KCCs are not able to answer. The\nHeads of Concerned Institutions may send a Roster of nominated\nexperts at Monthly/Fortnightly intervals to the KCCs designated for the\nconcerned States available on the link\nhttp://mkisan.gov.in/kccstatesinvolvement.aspx. Similarly the\nScientists from SAUs and SMSs in the KVKs may also be mapped in the\nCall Escalation Matrix of the Kisan Call Centres to provide their\ncomments to State/District level officers of Agriculture and allied sector\non the farmers queries escalated to them through KKMS as detailed at\nthe link http://mkisan.gov.in/kccescalationmatrix.aspx.\n5.5 Additional requirement of TA/DA, etc. will be met by the respective\nDepartments from their own budgetary allocations. However, funds available under\nATMA Cafeteria for Research-Extension-Farmer linkages may also be appropriately\nutilized.\n5.6 Senior officials from DA&FW and DARE/ICAR would be visiting the States\nfrom time to time to review the progress in getting better coordination and interface\nbetween the scientific community and the State agriculture machinery on the one\nhand and the farmers on the other.\n5.7 State Governments shall give wide publicity to this arrangement and furnish\nreport on regular basis on the convergence matrix in prescribed format given at\nAnnexure-II of ATMA Guidelines, 2025.\nPage 39 of 122",
    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 40):\nVI. CONVERGENCE OF EXTENSION ACTIVITIES WITH\nOTHER SCHEMES\nPage 40 of 122",
    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 41):\n6. CONVERGENCE OF EXTENSION WORK WITH OTHER SCHEMES\n6.1.1. Farmers’ skill trainings and field extension as contained in other schemes of DA&FW\nmay be converged with similar farmer-related activities going on through ATMA. Thus, for\ninstance, Seed Village programmes under SMSP, capacity building of farmers through\ninstitutions identified by the State Government under SMAM and pest monitoring, Farmer\nField Schools & Integrated Pest Management (IPM) trainings to farmers under SMPP will only\nbe carried out through the district level institutions of ATMA and Block Technology Teams.\nMutually synergetic linkages will be established among various activities instead of\nunilaterally mandating that all such farmer-centric activities shall be carried out through\nATMA. For instance, half day’s training given under Seed Village Programme shall also be\nmade part of Farm Schools as, in any case, training on seed technologies form a part of 6\ncritical stages during which farmers are trained under Farm Schools conducted under ATMA.\nThis convergence should be institutionalized by ensuring that State Extension Work Plan\n[which emanates from Strategic Research and Extension Plan (SREP)] covers field level\ntraining & extension components. SREP is an ideal platform to provide convergence from the\nconceptual level and prioritization point of view. IDWG will further underline such a\nconvergent approach at the State level.\n6.1.2 A single ATMA Governing Board headed by the District Magistrate will provide\ncommonality in approach & implementation and avoid duplication. ATMA Governing\nBoard shall act as an over-arching umbrella at District level to oversee all extension\nrelated activities in other schemes of Pradhan Mantri -Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana(PM-\nRKVY) and Krishonnati Yojana(KY). Such a holistic approach will avoid duplication of\nefforts and promote more extensive & inclusive coverage of beneficiaries. The Integrated\nICT platforms (such as Farmers’ Portal, State Agriculture Portals, Central Agriculture\nPortal) will also provide requisite impetus to implementation in the field level.\n6.1.3.Convergence with other Farmer Centric Schemes of DA&FW: With the given\nman-power support, ATMAs will also look after the work related to other schemes of\nPradhan Mantri -Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana(PM-RKVY) and Krishonnati Yojana(KY).\nThere should be full convergence of extension related work being carried out under\ndifferent programmes/schemes. The field level extension workers under these different\nprogrammes/schemes should work in conjunction with the dedicated manpower being\nprovided under this Scheme under the umbrella of BTT or ATMA, as the case may be.\nPage 41 of 122",
    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 42):\nWhile these extension related workers & consultants under other schemes/programmes\ncan continue to act as experts in their respective fields, they should also double up as\nmultifunctional extension workers in the jurisdiction to be assigned to them by the\nBTT/ATMA. Budget for extension related components in different schemes and\nprogrammes of DA&FW shall be dovetailed at district level through ATMA. Once all the\nextension related workers start working in unison, they shall be fully responsible for\nachieving convergence & synergy in extension related work under PM-RKVY and KY\nSchemes to achieve complementarities and check duplication of efforts and resources.\n6.1.4. Convergence with Research System: ATMA scheme provides for active\ninvolvement of Research System/ Research Agencies at different levels of\nimplementation. State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs)\nhave to be fully involved not only in preparation of SREP and Extension Work Plans but\nalso in implementation of various programmes in the field. They will be represented in all\nbodies, namely, ATMA GB and ATMA MC in districts, SLSC/ IDWGs at State level, BTT -\nBFAC Meetings at Block level. In addition, each KVK scientist may be made in charge of\none or more Blocks within the district. The KVK Scientist will technically advise the BTT\nand will also be actively involved in preparation of BAPs, especially with regard to\nresearch related issues/gaps and strategies. He will also take feedback from his\ncolleagues in the KVK in respect of their respective areas of expertise.\nA joint circular on convergence between Agricultural Research and Extension signed by\nthe Secretary (DARE) & DG, ICAR and the Secretary (A&C) was issued to all concerned on\n17th June, 2015.\n6.1.5 Joint Visits by Scientists and Extension Functionaries:\nQuite often it has been seen that scientists of the Universities and ICAR Institutions\nrefrain from making field visits due to inadequate provision of mobility in their budget.\nIn order to ensure proper mobility of the scientists accompanied by extension workers,\nfunds have been provisioned for meeting the expenditure towards hiring of vehicles or\nPOL expenses for field visits of scientists along with extension functionaries. It is\nexpected that at-least 5 pre- identified villages would be covered in a month under the\nvisit.\n6.1.6 Convergence with Development Departments: Necessary convergence with all\nline departments is to be ensured through their involvement in the process of preparation\nof SREP and Work Plans at Block, District & State levels. Work Plans to be submitted to\nPage 42 of 122",
    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 43):\nSLSC for approval should specify the activities which are to be supported out of\nresources from other schemes and activities which are to be funded under ATMA\nScheme. Necessary convergence is to be ensured through integration of Comprehensive\nDistrict Action Plans (CDAPs) and District Agriculture Action Plans (DAAPs) – all of which\nwill form an integral part of Annual Action Plan(AAP) to be approved by State Level\nSanctioning Committee (SLSC) under Pradhan Mantri -Rashtriya Krishi Vikas\nYojana(PM-RKVY) and Krishonnati Yojana(KY).). Further, within approved allocations of\nScheme, the State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) may also approve inter\ncomponent changes as per need during the course of implementation of the Work Plan,\nwithin ambit of Guidelines, which should be reported to DA&FW immediately. Active\ninvolvement of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) in the selection of beneficiaries for\nvarious farmer oriented activities, including selection of Farmer Friend should be\nensured.\n6.1.7 Convergence with & Involvement of Non-Governmental Sector:\n(a) In order to ensure promotion of multi-agency extension strategies, and to implement\nscheme activities in Service Provider mode, at least 10% of scheme allocation on\nrecurring activities at district level is to be incurred through Non-Governmental Sector\nviz. NGOs, FOs, PRIs, Cooperatives, Para-Extension Workers, Agri-preneurs, Input\nSuppliers, etc. Non-governmental implementing agencies viz. NGOs, FOs, PRIs, Para-\nExtension Workers (except Agri-preneurs trained under ACABC) and Cooperatives will\nbe eligible for service charge with a ceiling of 10% of the cost of extension activities\n(but no staff cost) implemented through them in addition to the cost of activity.\nOutsourcing will nevertheless be confined to such activities where the organization\nconcerned has expertise and requisite skills and the manpower deployed under ATMA\nis unable to perform such tasks due to multifarious tasks. Agri-preneurs under\nACABC can also be covered for this 10% service charge and 100% cost of activity after\nthey clear their loan liability though they can be called as experts on honorarium\nanytime for any training organized otherwise. These organizations are free to\nvoluntarily contribute to the cost of training or fully/partially bear the service\ncharges.\nExclusion of any Agri-preneurs or Para-extension workers from this category which\nare considered big enough can be done at the discretion of the State Governments\nconcerned. These agencies will be identified at the district level on the basis of merit\nPage 43 of 122",
    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 44):\nand approval of ATMA (GB) will be obtained. Competitive and transparent bidding\nprocess for this as per extent rules and regulations and financial norms. Expenditure\nincurred by the State Government for extension work (viz. service provider mode)\nshall count towards the threshold figure of 10% as stipulated in sub-para (a) above.\n6.2. NETWORKING:\nState level bodies/ officers viz. State Nodal Officer/ State Coordinator/ Gender\nCoordinator will ensure networking of all ATMAs so as to foster information\nsharing (success stories, best practices, research/ extension issues, application of\ninnovative technologies & strategies, etc.). All States/Districts shall share\ninformation regarding their activities/ innovations/ successes to the outside\nworld on the national ATMA portal (www.extensionreforms.dacnet.nic.in). Also\nprogress of the scheme activities shall be reported on the national ATMA portal.\nThis Portal shall also have links to related websites both at State and National\nlevel.\nPage 44 of 122",

MONITORING & EVALUATION (M&E)/Monitoring Framework:\n7.1 In order to ensure quality of extension activities, following monitoring\nframework is provided in the revised guidelines at different levels:\ni. At Block Level: Block Farmers Advisory Committee (BFAC) and Block\nTechnology Team (BTT) constituted under the Scheme will monitor Block level\nATMA activities on quarterly basis by conducting a meeting of farmers along-\nwith elected representatives of panchayat. Farmer Friend / ATM will\ncoordinate and facilitate these meetings. Feedback of the meeting will be\nshared with the district-level agency for suitably incorporating in the future\nplanning for improving effectiveness of the Scheme. Block Action Plan (BAP)\nwill be prepared at block level in consultation with BFAC & BTT.\nii. At District Level: ATMA Governing Board headed by DM or CDO or CEO as\ndecided by DM will review and monitor District level ATMA activities in every\nquarter and decide integration and re-designing of on-going developmental\nschemes in accordance with the Strategic Research and Extension Plans\n(SREP) of the District. The Governing Board will provide policy directions that\nsupport effective functioning of ATMA in the district and amend the rules and\nbye-laws for the agency. ATMA management committee and District Farmers\nAdvisory Committee (DFAC) will provide input for developing District Annual\nAgriculture Plan (DAAP) incorporating BAPs of all the blocks in the district.\nPD, ATMA of the district will coordinate and facilitate convening of the\nmeetings of ATMA, GB / ATMA, MC / DFAC at prescribed intervals.\niii. At State Level: State Nodal Cell (ATMA) compile District Annual Agriculture\nPlan (DAAP) of all the districts at the state level in the form of ‘State Extension\nWork Plan’ (SEWP) and place it before the Inter-Departmental Working Group\n(IDWG) in the meeting for consideration and approval before sending AAP to\nthe SLSC constituted under the Chairperson-ship of the Chief Secretary of the\nState for approval of AAP of both PM-RKVY and KY Schemes. The IDWG\nPage 46 of 122",

Secretary (Agriculture), may continue\nwith the day to day (in its quarterly meetings) monitoring to ensure that the\nextension reforms are executed in line with the provisions contained in ATMA\nGuidelines. There is an in built provision in the Cafeteria of ATMA Activities to\ncarry out concurrent evaluation for regular improvement in the quality of the\nschematic activities. It deals with things such as when the programme\nactivities occur, where they occur, and who delivers them. Thus, it involves\nthe evaluation of all the activities under taken to achieve programme objectives.\nThe feedback generated through this evaluation can be used for improving\nimplementation of the programme by focusing on mid-season / term\ncorrection. The concurrent evaluation is to be undertaken every year during\nthe course of implementation of the schematic activities. The purpose is to\nconduct a broad based SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and\nThreats) analysis so that mid-course correction is initiated at the appropriate\npoint of time. State Nodal Officer (ATMA) will coordinate and facilitate to\nconvene the meetings of IDWG and SLSC at the prescribed periodic\nintervals.\niv. At National Level: Progress of extension work done by ATMAs through\ndifferent extension activities shall also be monitored at national level on\nquarterly basis under the Chairmanship of Joint Secretary (Extension). Joint\nDirector (Extension Reforms) will initiate proposal to convene the National\nLevel Review Meetings of ATMA activities on quarterly basis. A web-based\ninterface (https://extensionreforms.da.gov.in) has been provided for regular\nmonitoring of the progress of extension activities.

    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 51):\n8. ALLOCATIONS AND SCHEME COST\n8.1 Centre–State Share : The funding support for the Scheme shall be in the ratio\nof 60:40 (Centre : State) between Central and State Governments and on 90:10\nbasis (Centre : State)between central and North-Eastern and Himalayan States\nfor all components including Farmer Friend. 100% GOI funding support to be\nprovided to UTs for all components.\n8.2 State-wise Allocation Criteria : Some States have very small districts\nwhereas some other States have very large districts but the size of the Block\ndoes not vary much from State to State. Therefore, funds available under the\nscheme shall be initially allocated to States after giving weightage to the\nnumber of Blocks, number of farm families in the State and number of\ndedicated deployed manpower. Actual release of resources to States shall,\nhowever, be on the basis of approved work plans, pace of utilization of funds\nand physical progress.\n8.3 Incentive to States for Better Performance : The States may prepare a large\nshelf of projects/activities and submit them to the Department at beginning of\nfinancial year. Better performing States will be encouraged to seek higher revised\nallocations against approved activities in respect of Work Plans submitted by\nthem. Such allocations over and above tentative allocation already communicated\nto States will depend upon relative progress in implementation and pace of\nexpenditure amongst various States and over all availability of funds. However, it\nis clarified that the expenditure during the year will be restricted by States to\nfunds actually placed at their disposal by the DA&FW and States should not incur\nexpenditure in excess of funds already available with the States. Any proposal to\nthe DA&FW in the following financial year for reimbursement of excess\nexpenditure will not be entertained. Thus, State may not create any liability.\n8.4. RELEASE OF FUNDS :\n8.4.1 Funds will be released for implementing the Scheme, in four equal\ninstallments. State Governments to comply all the instructions of Department of\nExpenditure O.M dated 23.03.2021 and 23.03.2022. 75% of annual allocation(3\nequal installments) will be released upon approved SEWP by SLSC/in-principle\napproval of SEWP by the Chairman of SLSC and Provisional Utilization\nCertificate (PUC) & Annual Progress Report (APR) of previous financial year.\nAdditional 25% of allocation(4th installment) will be released upon approved\nSEWP by SLSC, AUC & APR of the previous year and latest MPR showing at\nleast 75% utilization of earlier release (central + state share).

    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 54):\nOTHER OPERATIONAL MATTERS\n9.1 Extent of Coverage: The Scheme shall be implemented in all districts across the\ncountry.\n9.2 Incentives for difficult areas : In order to carry out extension activities in\ndifficult areas, an additional 10% allocation may be made by the states in the\ndifficult areas viz: Left Wing Affected Districts, North Eastern & Hilly States,\nAspirational Districts and Double Stressed Districts.\n9.3 Individual beneficiary oriented activities:\ni. The Cafeteria of Activities contains some individual beneficiary oriented\ncomponents as well. Some of such activities include farmers training,\ndemonstrations, farm schools, farmer-scientist interactions & exposure visits\nwhich have been culled out from the cafeteria and summarized in Annexure\nXI.\nii. Transparent and objective selection of beneficiaries is of paramount\nimportance not only to generate confidence of the farmers in the Scheme but\nalso to ensure that benefits of extension services get disseminated to all\nsections of the Society. Therefore, selection of beneficiaries should be done in\nthe following manner:\na) All Panchayats in a Block should be covered on a rotation basis under\nvarious components. The Panchayats to be covered in a year should be\ndecided by the BTT in consultation with the BFAC.\nb) Activity mapping of Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI) is at ANNEXURE-X.\nc) Number of beneficiaries of different categories including SC/ST in\nshortlisted Panchayats will be decided by the BTT in proportion to their\npopulation in consultation with BFAC so as to have a balanced coverage.\nd) At least 50% beneficiaries must be Small and Marginal Farmers and 30%\nbeneficiaries should be women farmers/farm women.\ne) Individual beneficiaries of demonstration plots, inter-district & inter-state\ntrainings within a Panchayat area and all farmer group beneficiaries\nshould be selected by the respective Gram Sabha or Gram Panchayats in\nconsultation with FIGs and FOs working in the area, as the State\nGovernment may decide. However, if for some reasons, the list of\nbeneficiaries is not finalized in the above manner within the stipulated\ntime frame, the FAC in consultation with FIGs and FOs may select the\nbeneficiaries for various activities under the scheme.\nPage 54 of 122",
    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 55):\nIf the list of\nbeneficiaries is not\nfinalized in time, the\nBFAC in consultation\nwith FIGs &FOs may\nselect the beneficiaries\nf) For rewards and incentives at different levels, beneficiaries may be\nidentified by the States in a transparent manner. It should be ensured\nthat no farmer gets double benefits of the same kind from different\nschemes.\ng) ATMAs should capture Unique Identification (UID) details of the farmer\nbeneficiaries under the components of availing training, exposure visits,\ndemonstration plots, farm schools, revolving fund for the CIGs etc. and\nupload the details in the Extension Reforms Monitoring System (ERMS)\nPortal developed by the Department.\n9.4 Common Issues related to ATMA Cafeteria:\ni. Minimum 30% of resources meant for programmes and activities are\nrequired to be allocated to women farmers and women extension\nfunctionaries. Specific documentation of expenditure and performance for\nwomen may be kept.\nii. No expenditure shall be incurred from extension work plan allocation on\nineligible items.

NGOs, FOs, PRIs, Cooperatives, Para-Extension\nWorkers, Agri-preneurs, Input Suppliers, etc. Since a lot of manpower and\ninfrastructure has been given under the Scheme for providing extension\nservices, the State Government should fix an upper limit on extension services\nin Service Provider mode. This percentage limit should be clearly spelt out in\nthe SEWP.\n(ii) Non-governmental implementing agencies viz. NGOs, FOs, PRIs, Para-Extension\nWorkers (except Agri-preneurs trained under ACABC) and Cooperatives will be\neligible for service charge with a ceiling of 10% of the cost of extension activities\n(but no staff cost) implemented through them in addition to the cost of activity.\nOutsourcing will nevertheless be confined to such activities where the\norganisation concerned has expertise and requisite skills and the manpower\ndeployed under ATMA is unable to perform such tasks due to multifarious\ntasks. Agri-preneurs under ACABC can also be covered for this 10% service\ncharge and 100% cost of activity after they clear their loan liability though they\ncan be called as experts on honorarium anytime for any training organized\notherwise. These organizations are free to voluntarily contribute to the cost of\ntraining or fully/partially bear the service charges.\nPage 56 of 122",

The list\nof such farmers having potential for organizing farm schools in the Block for\ndifferent sectors will be identified jointly by FAC and BTT and sent to ATMA\nGB through the Panchayat Samiti (block level elected body of Panchayati\nRaj Institutions). “Farm Schools” and “Farm School Trainers” for each\nseason will finally be approved by the ATMA GB.\n(iv) “Teachers” in the Farm Schools could be progressive farmers, extension\nfunctionaries or experts belonging to Government or Non-Government\nSector.\n(v) One of the main activities of Farm Schools would be to operationalize Front\nLine Demonstrations in one or more crops and/or allied sector activities.\nThese demonstrations would focus on Integrated Crop Management\nincluding field preparation, seed treatment, IPM, INM, etc.\n(vi) Farm Schools would provide season long technical backstopping/training to\ntarget farmers by having an interactive session once at least during each of\nthe 6 critical stages in a cropping season.\n(vii) While selecting the trainee farmers, about 50% representation should be given\nto small and marginal farmers. Preference may be given to members of\nCIGs/FIGs.\n(viii) “Students” will visit Farm Schools as per specified schedule or as may be\nnecessary. “Teachers” may also visit students as may be necessary.\n(ix) Knowledge and skills of “teachers” would be upgraded on a continuous basis\nthrough training at district/ state/ national level institutions and/or\nexposure visits, etc.\n(x) In addition to technical support through Farm Schools, knowledge and skill of\n“students” may also be upgraded through training at District/State level\nand exposure visits, etc. “Students” would have the responsibility of providing\nextension support to other farmers in the respective village or neighbouring\nvillages.\n(xi) Maximum Service Charge to achiever farmer may be 10% of the total cost\nincurred on item No.1-5 of Farm School cost norm given at (Appendix-II).\n\nATMA GUIDELINES, 2025 UNDER SMAE OF KRISHONNATI YOJANA\n\nThe following is a table with important data:\n|  |\n| 93 |\n|  |",

BTM should act as\ncoordinator for Farm Schools with periodic monitoring of the activities done\nat his level (at least 1 visit at every critical crop stages) to oversee and\nmonitor the functioning & maintain record of visits. He may arrange an\nInterface between the achiever farmers (taking up Farm School) and the BTT\n& KVK scientists at least on quarterly basis to exchange ideas at district\nlevel.\n(xv) Performance of all farm schools in each block should be reviewed at BTT-FAC\nmeetings on a half-yearly basis and by ATMA GBs on an annual basis.\n(xvi) For the reasons to be recorded in writing, highly successful Farm Schools\nmay be continued for another season or two, with provision of only\nrecurring expenses during subsequent years/seasons.

    "Information from document 'pdf2.pdf' (Page 107):\nAnnexure XII\nConcept Note on Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) based Training of Farmers\n1. Background:\nAgriculture represent significant and skilled sector in which majority of the\ncultivation task need higher skills that include land preparation, seed treatment,\nsowing, fertilizer application, pest management, farm mechanization, irrigation,\nharvesting, storage, marketing etc. Several cultivation tasks involve intellectual\nunderstanding of the package of practices, tools & techniques and process to\nexecute farming practices.\nAs a matter of fact, farmers are performing field operations from production to\nmarketing of farm produce and skilfully undertaken such activities by virtue of\ntheir traditional & scientific knowledge and farming experience. It has often been\nfelt that most of the Indian farmers have only access to traditional knowledge and\nin most cases there is huge gap in existing knowledge and new skill sets required\nin modernizing agriculture.\nBesides, farmers need to be empowered with latest farming technologies like\nirrigation systems, mechanization, high yielding varieties, INM and IPM. However\napplication of technology requires up-gradation of knowledge through training and\nadvisory services. This shall be achieved through short-term bridge courses in the\npriority areas of agriculture and allied sector, which will act as enabler for up-\nskilling and empowering the farmers.\n2. Vision: To recognize the prior learning and up-skilling of 1.25 crore farmers in\nnext five years for the period from 2021-22 to 2025-26.\n3.

    "Information from document 'pdf3.pdf' (Page 4):\nCHAPTER I\nIntegrated Scheme for Agricultural Marketing (ISAM)\n1. The grit and toil of farmers, dedication of agricultural scientists and consistent\nendeavour of policy makers have together contributed in transforming Indian\nagriculture from an importer of food grain at the time of independence to a major\nexporter of foodgrains now. However, the marketing systems and post-harvest\nmarketing infrastructure have not been able to keep pace with the growing\nproduction and marketable surplus. This has brought to the fore, the need for\nproviding farmers with access to competitive markets with adequate infrastructure\nincluding cold chain logistics, to enable them to realise better prices on the one hand\nand providing nutritious food to consumers at stable and affordable prices on the\nother. With this objective in view, the Government of India on 13th November, 2013\napproved the proposal of Department of Agriculture & Cooperation for continuation\nand integration of on-going Central Sector Schemes as Integrated Scheme for\nAgricultural Marketing (ISAM) during the XII Plan (2012-2017). The ISAM will have\nthe following five sub schemes :- (i) Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) [the\nexisting schemes of Grameen Bhandaran Yojana (GBY) and Development/\nStrengthening of Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure, Grading and Standardization\n(AMIGS) will be merged as AMI] (ii) Marketing Research and Information Network\n(MRIN) (iii) Strengthening of Agmark Grading Facilities (SAGF), (iv) Agri-Business\nDevelopment (ABD) through Venture Capital Assistance (VCA) and Project\nDevelopment Facility (PDF) and (v) Choudhary Charan Singh National Institute of\nAgriculture Marketing (NIAM).\n2. Objectives:\nI. To promote creation of agricultural marketing infrastructure by providing\nbackend subsidy support to State, cooperative and private sector\ninvestments.\nII. To promote creation of scientific storage capacity and to promote pledge\nfinancing to increase farmers’ income.\nIII. To promote Integrated Value Chains (confined up to the stage of primary\nprocessing only) to provide vertical integration of farmers with primary\nprocessors.\nIV. To use ICT as a vehicle of extension to sensitize and orient farmers to\nrespond to new challenges in agricultural marketing.\nV. To establish a nation-wide information network system for speedy collection\nand dissemination of market information and data on arrivals and prices for its\nefficient and timely utilization by farmers and other stake holders.",
    "Information from document 'pdf3.pdf' (Page 5):\nVI. To support framing of grade standards and quality certification of agricultural\ncommodities to help farmers get better and remunerative prices for their\ngraded produce.\nVII. To catalyze private investment in setting up of agribusiness projects and\nthereby provide assured market to producers and strengthen backward\nlinkages of agri-business projects with producers and their groups.\nVIII. To undertake and promote training, research, education, extension and\nconsultancy in the agri marketing sector.\n3. The overall budgetary allocation for ISAM is Rs.4548 crores during the XII\nPlan. Sub scheme-wise break up of budget provision is Rs.4000.00 crores for AMI,\nRs.12.00 crores for MRIN, Rs.6.00 crores for SAGF, Rs.500.00 crores for ABD and\nRs.30.00 crores for NIAM.\n4. The Marketing Division in the Department of Agriculture is the overall incharge\nof policy formulation for the agricultural marketing sector. The Directorate of\nMarketing & Inspection (DMI) an attached office of the Department will implement\nthe three sub schemes viz. Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI), Marketing\nResearch and Information Network (MRIN) and Strengthening of Agmark Grading\nFacilities (SAGF); Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC), an autonomous\norganisation will implement the sub scheme ofAgri-Business Development (ABD)\nthrough Venture Capital Assistance (VCA) and Project Development Facility (PDF)\nand Chaudhary Charan Singh National Institute of Agriculture Marketing (NIAM),\nalso an autonomous organisation under the Department will provide training,\nresearch and consultancy to stakeholders in the agri marketing sector.\n5. While separate guidelines have been formulated for each of the sub scheme\nto be implemented by the respective organisations mentioned in para 4 above,\nhowever, the Marketing Division of Department of Agriculture and Cooperation will\nhave overarching responsibilities for the smooth implementation of the sub schemes.\nTowards this, Marketing Division may claim up to 0.5% of the scheme funds at its\nlevel for incurring administrative expenditure towards more effective MIS, monitoring,\nimpact assessment, hiring consultants, conducting studies, researches and any\nother facilitative mechanism for more effective implementation.\n6. An Empowered Committee constituted under the chairmanship of Additional\nSecretary (DAC) and comprising of Joint Secretary (Marketing) / Agricultural\nMarketing Adviser, Director (Marketing), Joint Agricultural Marketing Adviser and\nDirector / Deputy Secretary (Finance), IFD, DAC will resolve difficulties and smaller\ncase to case specific decisions on implementation issues.\n7. The guidelines for sub scheme of Agri-Business Development to be\nimplemented by SFAC will come into effect from 24.01.2014. All other sub schemes\nof ISAM will come into effect from 1st April, 2014. .",
    "Information from document 'pdf3.pdf' (Page 6):\nCHAPTER II\nAGRICULTURAL MARKETING INFRASTRUCTURE (AMI)\n1 INTRODUCTION\n1.1 The country has largely gained self-sufficiency in food production. There is a\nneed to translate this into better remuneration for the producers by increasing focus\non agricultural marketing sector. The agricultural marketing sector requires\nstrengthening of supply chain through investments in infrastructure for value addition\nto agricultural produce, reduction in post- harvest losses, etc. The XII Plan Working\nGroup on ‘Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure, Secondary Agriculture and Policy\nRequired for Internal and External Trade’ has estimated an investment requirement\nof Rs.56,000 crores for marketing infrastructure and value chain development during\nthe Plan period with a budgetary allocation of Rs.20,207 crores. It has also estimated\na requirement of 35 million MT storage capacity during XII Plan period. The\nPlanning Commission Working Group on Warehousing Development and Regulation\nfor the XII Plan Period (2012 – 17) has stated that Warehousing plays a vital role in\npromoting agricultural marketing, rural banking and financing and ensuring food\nsecurity in the country. A network of scientifically constructed storage infrastructure\nwill help farmers avoid distress sale of their produce by availing marketing credit\nthrough pledge financing and also reduce quantitative and qualitative post-harvest\nlosses.\n1.2 For creation of agricultural marketing infrastructure, Grameen Bhandaran\nYojana (GBY) is being implemented since 01.04.2001 and Scheme for\nDevelopment/Strengthening of Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure, Grading &\nStandardisation (AMIGS) is being implemented from 20.10.2004. In the Integrated\nScheme for Agriculture Marketing (ISAM), these two viz GBY and AMIGS are being\nsubsumed into one sub scheme, which would henceforth be known as Agricultural\nMarketing Infrastructure (AMI).\n1.3 The sub scheme on AMI will be implemented by the Directorate of Marketing\n& Inspection (DMI), an attached office of Department of Agriculture and Cooperation.\nA list of Regional / Sub-Offices of DMI is at Annexure I.\n1.4 During the XII Plan period, the sub scheme on AMI would be implemented\nwith central assistance of Rs.4000 crores. The sub scheme will target to create 4000\nmarketing infrastructure projects and storage capacity of 230 lakh tonnes across the\ncountry.",
    "Information from document 'pdf3.pdf' (Page 7):\n2. OBJECTIVES:\nThe main objectives of the sub scheme are:\n2.1.

INTRODUCTION :\n1.1 Market information is needed by farmers in planning production and marketing of\ntheir produce and equally needed by other market participants in arriving at optimal\nmarketing decisions. The availability and dissemination of complete and accurate marketing\ninformation is key to achieve both operational and pricing efficiency in the marketing system.\nAdvancement in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has made the world a\nsmaller place and a larger market at one go. To fully utilize the new emerging marketing\nopportunities for the benefit of farming community, establishment of an ICT based\n\"Agricultural Marketing Information Network” in the country has become inevitable.\n1.2 Ministry of Agriculture had launched the ICT based Central Sector Scheme of\nAgricultural Marketing Information Network (AGMARKNET), in March, 2000, to link important\nagricultural produce markets spread all over the country and the State Agriculture Marketing\nBoards and Directorates. The project is being executed with the technical support of National\nInformatics Centre (NIC). A total number of 3,549 computers were provided under the\nscheme to 3,241 agricultural produce markets (Annexure-I) up to March, 2013. Computers\nwere also provided to State Agricultural Marketing Boards/ Directorates, etc. An application\nsoftware package 'AGMARK', has been developed to facilitate organization and transmission\nof market data from the markets.\n1.3 In order to strengthen interface with farmers and other beneficiaries, AGMARKNET\nportal (http://agmarknet.nic.in) has been developed. More than 2200 markets are regularly\nreporting price and arrivals related data which is being disseminated through the portal. The\nAGMARKNET portal also serves as a single window for accessing websites of various other\norganizations concerned with agricultural marketing. It provides weekly arrivals and price\ntrend analysis for important markets in respect of major agricultural commodities transacted.\nIt is also linked with Online Commodity Exchange of India Limited, providing futures prices in\nrespect of oilseeds, crops, etc. International price trends of various agricultural commodities\navailable on FAO website are also accessible through the portal. The portal is constantly\nbeing enriched.\n1.4 During XI plan period 590 new market nodes were covered and replacements of\ncomputers for 574 old nodes were undertaken. Out of the existing 7,190 wholesale markets\nin the country, 3,241 i.e. 45 % had on-line facility under the scheme till the end of XI Plan.\nDuring XII Plan, 3,700 new markets are proposed to be covered under the network using\nmobile and SMS technology in addition to computers.\n2. OBJECTIVES\n2.1 To establish a nation-wide information network for speedy collection and\ndissemination of market information and data for its efficient and timely utilization;",
    "Information from document 'pdf3.pdf' (Page 66):\n2.2 To facilitate collection and dissemination of information related to better price\nrealization and market access by the farmers. This would cover:\n(i) Market related information such as market fee, market charges, costs, method of sale,\npayment, weighment, handling, market functionaries, development programmes, market\nlaws, dispute settlement mechanism, composition of market committees, income and\nexpenditure, etc.\n(ii) Price-related information such as minimum, maximum and modal prices of varieties and\nqualities transacted, total arrivals and dispatches with destination, marketing costs and\nmargins, etc.\n(iii) Infrastructure related information comprising facilities and services available to the\nfarmers with regard to storage and warehousing, cold storage, direct markets, grading,\nre-handling and repacking etc.\n(iv) Market requirement related information covering accepted standards and grades,\nlabeling, sanitary and phyto-sanitary requirements, pledge finance, marketing credit and\nnew opportunities available in respect of better marketing;\n2.3 To sensitize and orient farmers to respond to new challenges in agricultural\nmarketing by using ICT as a vehicle of extension;\n2.4 To improve efficiency in agricultural marketing through regular training and extension\nfor reaching region-specific farmers in their own language; and\n2.5 To provide assistance for marketing research to generate marketing information for\nits dissemination to farmers and other marketing functionaries at grass-root level to create\nan ambience of good marketing practices in the country.\n2.6 The information relating to the schemes in respect of agricultural marketing\nimplemented by Government Departments and central agencies viz. Commerce, Food and\nPublic Distribution, Consumer Affairs, Health and CCI, JCI, NCDC, NAFED, NTGF, TRIFED,\nNCCF, NDDB, NHB, APEDA, MPEDA will also be disseminated in user friendly manner.\nOnce the farm produce is standardized and labelled, backed by quality certification, it can be\ndirectly offered for sale on Spot Exchange websites in national and international markets.\n3. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN :\n3.1 The agencies involved in execution of the sub scheme are Directorate of Marketing\nand Inspection (DMI), National Informatics Centre (NIC), State Governments through State\nAgriculture Marketing Boards (SAMBs)/ Directorates, other National and State level\ninstitutions and individual market committees/ authorities wherever applicable in the country.\n3.2 Efforts will be made to involve private sector in collection of data and maintenance of\nthe data base. PPP options will be explored to bring expertise and value addition to this\nactivity.\n3.3 Overall Plan for connectivity: Supply of Computers and other peripherals as well as\ninstallation will be implemented through the vendors empaneled by IT Division of DAC\nand/or, other sources such as NIC, APMC, State Departments/Agencies in concerned\nmarket nodes. The concerned market nodes will arrange internet connectivity through local\ninternet service provider.",
    "Information from document 'pdf3.pdf' (Page 67):\n3.4 It is proposed to also provide IT instruments such as mobile handsets etc. to the\nmarket nodes at principal market/ sub-market yard level through the State Implementing\nAgencies/other implementing agencies.\n3.5 NIC’s role: NIC will develop required software applications, train market personnel in\nhandling computer hardware and software, update the software package from time to time\nand develop and commission State level portals wherever requested. NIC will also arrange\nto harmonize/ integrate software packages used by the State Implementing Agencies and or\nany other Private Agency on their behalf for reporting data to the AGMARKNET Portal. It will\ncontinue to manage AGMARKNET portal and facilitate in updating of market information by\nthe market nodes to the portal. Management of AGMARKNET/State level portals could be\noutsourced wherever considered necessary by respective competent authorities. In case of\ndevelopment of software applications, other than NIC, it could also be out sourced to private\nagencies, if and when required.\n3.6 To improve the quality of data reporting on the portal, at DMI Headquarters, the\nAGMARKNET team will be strengthened from time to time by outsourcing professionals to\nmonitor and constantly update the portal, in accordance with GFR provisions and with the\nprior approval of IFD\n3.7 The State Implementing Agencies will provide to DMI the list of remaining markets to\nbe covered for connectivity and replacement of old computers under the sub scheme. The\nState Implementing Agencies must ensure site readiness for successful installation and\noperation of the node which shall be verified and certified by concerned DMI Office.In case\nof those markets, where installing computers may be difficult, IT instruments such as mobile\nhandsets or other instruments to harness mobile and sms/GPRS/2g/3G technology may be\nprovided\n3.8 Besides the existing system of reporting market information through use of\ncomputers in principal market yards, mobile/IT instruments based data reporting system will\nbe introduced for both principal market yards and sub-market yards so as to facilitate\ncollection of market information at grass root level at faster pace. For this, necessary\nAPPS for such IT instruments like mobile handset etc. will be developed through NIC or\nthrough outsourcing.\n3.9 Market node will collect and transmit relevant information to the State level and\nAGMARKNET portal. NIC/IT instrument Vendors would train 2 persons from each node in\noperating computer/mobile device and handling software package/APPS. The\nSAMB/Department will nominate a nodal officer to coordinate functioning of the node.

INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Grade Standards provide a common language for trade among growers,\ntraders, processors etc. They provide a basis for incentive payment rewarding better\nquality. Farmers get prices commensurate with the quality produced by them. Grade\nstandards help in electronic trading and issue of Negotiable Warehouse Receipt. The\nAgricultural Produce (Grading and Marking) Act, 1937 provides for framing of grade\nstandards and their certification. SAGF sub scheme of the ISAM Scheme is an\nongoing plan scheme to support grading and marking of agricultural produce, which\ninvolves framing of grade standards and certification of agricultural commodities\nincluded in the Schedule of the Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marking) Act,\n1937.SAGF sub scheme aims to help DMI implement the Act including meeting the\nexpenditure for the purchase of equipment, chemicals, glassware and apparatus,\nAnnual Maintenance Contract (AMC) of the equipment as well as renovation and\nrepair works in the Agmark laboratories/ Regional and Sub-offices of DMI. With this\nsupport, 11 Regional Agmark Laboratories and Central Agmark Laboratory, Nagpur\nare carrying out analysis of research samples and check samples for developing and\npromoting grading & standardization of agricultural commodities under Agmark.\n2. OBJECTIVES\n2.1 The main objectives of the sub scheme are:\n2.1.1 To help farmers get better and remunerative prices by grading of their\nproduce.\n2.1.2 To frame grade standards of agricultural commodities as per the provisions in\nAgricultural Produce ( Grading and Marking ) Act,1937.\n2.1.3 To implement AGMARK certification programme for commodities for which\ngrade standards are notified for domestic trade and for exports.\n2.1.4 To analyse research samples for creating analytical data base for the framing\n/revision of grade standards of agricultural commodities.\n3. Implementing Agency\n3.1 Directorate of Marketing & Inspection (DMI) in the Department of Agriculture &\nCooperation, Ministry of Agriculture, is the Nodal authority for certification of\nagricultural commodities including horticulture commodities under AGMARK.",
    "Information from document 'pdf3.pdf' (Page 78):\n4. Infrastructure for the Grading & Standardization Programme :\n4.1 DMI has infrastructure of 11 Regional Offices and 26 Sub-offices spread all\nover the country to implement the certification programme. Head Office at Faridabad\nattends to the policy matters and framing/revision of standards based on the Reports\nof research projects carried out at Central Agmark Laboratory(CAL).Eleven Regional\nAgmark Laboratories (RALs) spread all over the country provide analytical support\nfor the analysis of research samples and check samples drawn from the authorized\npackers’ premises and market. Central Agmark Laboratory at Nagpur is the apex\nlaboratory. The RALs at Mumbai & Chennai and CAL at Nagpur are accredited with\nNational Accreditation Board for Testing & Calibration Laboratories (Department of\nScience & Technology) as per ISO/ IEC 17025. The RALs at Delhi, Jaipur,\nKanpur,Kolkatta and Kochi are proposed to be accredited during the 12th Plan.\n5. Framing and Revision of Grade Standards.\n5.1 Framing of Grade Standards.\nStandards of agricultural commodities are framed in a scientific way. Basically it\ninvolves the following steps.\n5.1.1 Agricultural commodity for which grade standards are to be framed is selected\nbased on demand and necessity.\n5.1.2 A sampling plan is prepared based on the areas in which the commodity is\ngrown, processed and traded.\n5.1.3 Physical and chemical parameters to determine the purity and quality of the\ncommodity are identified.\n5.1.4 Samples of the commodity are collected by the field offices from growing\nareas, whole sale and retail markets as per the sampling plan.\n5.1.5 The samples are analysed in the Regional Agmark Laboratories and Central\nAgmark Laboratory of DMI for the identified parameters.\n5.1.6 Analytical data obtained is statistically analysed and Central Agmark\nLaboratory suggests the limits of various quality parameters for different\ngrades.\n5.1.7 The specifications of the commodity prescribed in relevant Regulations of\nFood Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and international standards viz. Codex\nAlimentarius Commission, ISO, etc. are consulted.\n5.1.8 Draft standards are discussed with trade, industry and consumer\norganizations.",
    "Information from document 'pdf3.pdf' (Page 79):\n5.1.9 Preliminary Grading & Marking Rules for the Commodity are drafted and are\nvetted by the Ministry of Law & Justice, translated into Hindi and published in\nthe Gazette of India for inviting comments and suggestions from all stake\nholders.\n5.1.10 The comments/suggestions received are considered and final notification is\ndrafted, vetted by the Ministry of Law & Justice, translated into Hindi and\npublished in the Gazette of India.\n5.2 Revision of Grade Standards:\nGrade Standards notified under the provisions of the Act are frequently\nrevised to keep pace with the development of new varieties of agricultural\ncommodities and technological advancements.\n6. Harmonization of Grade Standards:\n6.1 The grade standards are being harmonized with international standards such\nas Codex & ISO and standards framed by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The\ngrade standards of Codex, ISO, BIS and Food Safety and Standards Authority of\nIndia are consulted while framing the standards and revising them from time to time.\nEfforts are being made to have a single standard for raw agricultural commodities\nwhich is acceptable to all stakeholders viz. farmers, agricultural produce markets,\ncommodity exchanges, retail chains, consumers, etc.\n7. Focus on enhancement of income of the farmers:\n7.1 The grade standards of 213 agricultural commodities have been notified\nunder the provisions of the Act. These include raw, semi processed and processed\ncommodities. Focus in the 12th plan will be on raw agricultural commodities such as\ncereals, pulses, oil seeds and fruits and vegetables so that farmers get incentive for\ngrading the produce. Specific focus will be on the grade standards of fruits and\nvegetables and their grading and marking so that more countries recognize the\nAgmark certification system as already recognized by the European Union. The work\nof grading and marking of semi-processed and processed commodities where\ngrading and marking of these commodities does not result into direct enhancement\nof income of the farmers, will be transferred to concerned Ministry/ Department.\n8. Utilization of funds under the Sub Scheme:\n8.1 The concerned RAL will procure its required equipment with approval of the\ncompetent authority and by following the GFR provisions.\n8.2 For other components, provisions of GFR will be followed. All the components\nwill be implemented as per delegated financial powers\n9. Certification for Domestic Market:",
    "Information from document 'pdf3.pdf' (Page 80):\n9.1 The sub scheme for certification of agricultural commodities is voluntary as\nper the provisions of the Act. The persons desirous of certifying an agricultural\ncommodity under AGMARK should have hygienic premises, necessary infrastructure\nto process and pack the commodity and have access to a well equipped laboratory\nfor the estimation of prescribed parameters. The applicant for Certificate of\nAuthorisation can either set up his own laboratory or have access to an approved\nState Grading Laboratory or Commercial Laboratory approved by the DMI for\ngrading and marking of the commodities. The Chemist of the laboratory is trained in\none of the Regional Agmark Laboratories (RALs) and is approved for carrying out\ngrading and marking. Certificate of Authorisation ( C.A.) is granted to such parties\non their request after they submit the required documents and their capacity to\nprocess and pack the commodity and hygienic conditions in the premises are\nascertained. The approved Chemist of the C.A. holder analyses the processed\ncommodity for determining the grade standard and gets it packed in his presence.\n9.2 Check samples are drawn from premises of the authorised packers and\nmarket and these are analysed in RALs to keep check on the certification\nprogramme. Action to warn and suspend/cancel the Certificate of Authorisation is\ntaken, if any, check sample is found not conforming to prescribed standards.\n9.3 Use of technology will be made to enable C.A. holders and approved\nlaboratories. The present outdated system of issuing replica serial numbers will be\nreplaced by technology enabled system to minimize the human interaction between\nC.A. holders and officials and to make available these services on 24 by 7 basis.\n10. Certification for Exports:\nDMI is attending to certification of many agricultural commodities for exports.\nFruits and vegetables are important. European Commission has approved the\nconformity checking operations of DMI for pre shipment inspection for export of fresh\nfruits and vegetables to EU countries. Agricultural Marketing Adviser has been\nnotified as Official Authority and DMI as inspection body for the purpose. Inspection\nand certification is voluntary. DMI is attending to certification of fruits and\nvegetables for exports through approved laboratories. 13 laboratories spread all over\nthe country are approved to attend to grading and certification. Grapes, onions, okra\nand pomegranates are being certified for exports to EU countries. Efforts will be\nmade that certification of agricultural commodities including fruits and vegetables is\nrecognized by other countries also.\n11. Revision of Guidelines relating to Agmark Certification Programme.\nThe Guidelines for grant of Certificate of Authorisation for grading and\nmarking of agricultural commodities for domestic market as well for exports and the\nGuidelines for approval of State Grading\nLaboratory/Cooperative/Association/Commercial Laboratory for grading and marking",
    "Information from document 'pdf3.pdf' (Page 81):\nfor domestic grade and exports will be amended suitably in conformity with modern\npractices.\n12. Physical Targets:\n12.1 During the XII Plan period, it is proposed that all the standards will be aligned\nwith BIS and FSSAI. Focus will be on grading primary agricultural produce so as to\nhelp farmers in augmentation of incomes. Those activities and semi-processed,\nprocessed products will be rationalized which don’t result into direct benefits for the\nfarmers, in consultation with BIS etc. It is proposed to analyse 54,000 check samples\nand 10,300 research samples.\n13.

Introduction\n1.1 Farming is the single largest private sector economic activity in the country. The\ngrowth potential in this key sector is immense in view of the changes taking place in food\nconsumption and there is growing demand for high value processed products. Successes in\nsuch endeavors will require innovations and partnerships. Private agribusiness provide first\npoint market for the farm sector and growth depends principally on private initiatives. A\nsignificant portion of agribusiness activity is the result of small and medium enterprises.\nSuch enterprises are necessarily widespread in location to capture opportunities that arise\nall along the farm to table supply chain. Key constraints that impede development of new\nagribusiness projects are access to information and access to credit. Agribusiness\nentrepreneurs are generally first generation who have business skills but their financial\nresources are limited for setting up units at the farm gate with backward linkages. In order to\nfacilitate agribusiness development in the country SFAC venture capital sub scheme will:\n(a) Assist agripreneurs to make investments in setting up agribusiness projects\nthrough financial participation, and\n(b) Provide financial support for preparation of bankable Detailed Project Reports\n(DPRs) through Project Development Facility (PDF).\n2. Objectives\n2.1 The main objectives of the sub scheme are:\n(i) To facilitate setting up of agribusiness ventures in close association with all\nbanks/financial institutions notified by the Reserve Bank of India where the ownership of\nthe Central/State Government is more than 50% such as Nationalized banks, SBI & its\nsubsidiaries, IDBI, SIDBI, NABARD, NCDC, NEDFi, Exim Bank, RRBs & State Financial\nCorporations.\n(ii) To catalyze private investment in setting up of agribusiness projects and thereby\nproviding assured market to producers for increasing rural income & employment.\n(iii) To strengthen backward linkages of agri-business projects with producers.\n(iv) To assist farmers, producer groups, and agriculture graduates to enhance their\nparticipation in value chain through Project Development Facility.\n(v) To arrange training and visits, etc. of agripreneurs in setting up identified agribusiness\nprojects.\n(vi) To augment and strengthen existing set up of State and Central SFAC.\n3.

Market planning and designing to\ncreate state of art complex requires a professional approach.

However, it is pertinent to bring changes in the\nfocus of education in the perspective of new paradigm of agricultural marketing. In",

PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL AND IMPLEMENTATION\nSTRATEGY AND ROADMAP\n5.1 States will prepare the existing perspective/strategic plan and road map for overall development of\nhorticulture crops including Bamboo in respective state, duly projecting the targets to be achieved during\nthe XII Plan period. This will form the basis for preparing Annual Action Plan (AAP). The Strategy & Road\nMap formulated by States should invariably contain information on geography & climate, potential of\nhorticulture/bamboo development, availability of land, SWOC analysis, strategy for development and plan\nof action proposed to be taken to achieve goals in each district of the State. The document should focus\non crops having comparative advantage and natural potential for development in the State, adoption of\ncluster approach for production and linking with available infrastructure, or to be created, for post harvest\nmanagement, processing, marketing and export. While selecting the cluster, preference should be given\nto those areas where natural resource base and water resources have been developed under watershed\ndevelopment programmes, Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment\nGuarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), etc. Priority should be given for development of such crops, which are\nrequired to meet current and future demands.\nANNUAL ACTION PLAN\n5.2 In this context, AAP needs to be supported with data/write up on outcome of past interventions covering\nthe details of area expansion (variety/species introduced, increase in productivity achieved and number of\nclusters created), water resource development as per felt need of the State (amount of irrigation potential\ncreated, whether linked with micro irrigation, maintenance etc), INM/IPM (including requisite infrastructure\ncreated and how these are being utilized for benefit of farmers) and organic farming. Area expansion should\nbe determined based on availability of planting material and a seed/planting material sub-plan shall be\nprepared separately as part of AAP.\n5.3 Ministry of Agriculture will communicate the tentative outlay for the year to each State / NLA, which in turn\nwill indicate sector-wise/district-wise allocation. Agencies at District level will prepare AAP keeping in view\ntheir priority and potential and submit the plan to State Horticulture/Bamboo Mission within the allocated\nsum. The States may engage TSG/Consultancy services for preparation of Perspective/Strategic/Annual\nAction Plans.

Objective of the Scheme\nPradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) aims at supporting sustainable production in agriculture\nsector by way of\n• Providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of unforeseen events\n• Stabilizing the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming\n• Encouraging farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices\n• Ensuring flow of credit to the agriculture sector which will contribute to food security, crop\ndiversification and enhancing growth and competitiveness of agriculture sector besides protecting\nfarmers from production risks.\n2. Adoption of Technology for Scheme Administration:\n2.1 In an endeavour to integrate Technology in implementation and execution of the Scheme, the Govt. of\nIndia has designed and developed a National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP) (www. pmfby.gov.in). This\nwill bring in better administration and coordination amongst stakeholders viz. Farmers, States,\nInsurers and Banks as well as real time dissemination of information and transparency.\n2.2 The successful running of the Portal calls for responsible participation by different stakeholders who\nwill have the responsibility for census coding and updating revenue/administrative units, AWS code\nmapping and updating requisite information/details as per login credential module.\n2.3 Implementing States and Insurance Companies during each crop season are required to digitize and\nupload on the web Portal in the relevant module, basic information like notified areas, crops, sum\ninsured, Govt. subsidy, and premium to be paid by farmers and name of the implementing Insurance\nCompanies in the particular insurance unit etc., well within the prescribed time. This will facilitate\nfarmers and other stakeholders to get the relevant information on Internet and through SMS. State\nGovt. and concerned Insurance Company will be responsible for any incorrect entry/ errors/ omissions\netc.\n2.4 Digitization of basic information/notification should compulsorily be done before floating tender\ndocuments which will be followed by entry of bidded Premium rates and name of selected Insurance\nCompany immediately after finalization of bids and issue of work order.\n2.5 Since the National Crop Insurance Portal has been conceptualised for auto administration and\nseamless flow of data/information/reports on real time basis, State Govt. would not be allowed to\ncreate/use separate Portal/website for Crop Insurance purposes.\n2.6 All Stakeholders have defined roles and responsibilities and accessibility to related modules on the\nPortal for administration of the Scheme. Details of operationalization of modules for each\nstakeholder are available on the Portal for ready reference.",

However they may provide all requisite support to\nfacilitate Bank Branches/PACS for uploading the farmer’s details on the Portal well within the\nprescribed cut-off dates.\n2.9 Only farmers whose data is uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal shall be eligible for\nInsurance coverage and the premium subsidy from State and Central Govt. will be released\naccordingly.\n2.10 All data pertaining to crop-wise, area-wise historical yield data, weather data, sown area, coverage\nand claims data, calamity years and actual yield shall be made available on the National Crop\nInsurance Portal for the purpose of premium rating, claim calculation etc.\n2.11 Banks/Financial Institutions/other intermediaries need to compulsorily transfer the individual farmer’s\ndata electronically to the National Crop Insurance Portal. Accordingly Banks/FIs may endeavour to\nundertake CBS integration in a time bound manner for real time transfer of information/data.\n2.12 It is also proposed to develop an integrated platform/portal for both PMFBY and Interest Subvention\nScheme. The data/information of both the Schemes shall be auto synchronized to enable real time\nsharing of information and better program monitoring.\n2.13 Insurance Companies shall compulsorily use technology/mobile applications for monitoring of crop\nhealth/Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) in coordination with concerned States. States shall also\nfacilitate Insurance Companies with Satellite Imagery/Usage of Drones by way of prior approval of\nagency from which such data can be sourced. This is required for better monitoring and ground-\ntruthing.

Coverage of Farmers\n3.1 All farmers including sharecroppers and tenant farmers growing the notified crops in the notified areas\nare eligible for coverage. However, farmers should have insurable interest for the notified/insured\ncrops. The non-loanee farmers are required to submit necessary documentary evidence of land\nrecords prevailing in the State (Records of Right (RoR), Land possession Certificate (LPC) etc.) and/\nor applicable contract/ agreement details/ other documents notified/ permitted by concerned State\nGovt. in case of sharecroppers/tenant farmers and the same should be defined by the respective\nStates in the notification itself.\n3.1.1 Compulsory Component\n3.1.1.1 All farmers who have been sanctioned Seasonal Agricultural Operations (SAO) loans from Financial\nInstitutions (FIs) (i.e. loanee farmers) for the notified crop(s) season would be covered compulsorily.\nThis provision shall override any decision taken by FIs including PACS exempting farmers from\ncompulsory coverage of loanee farmers.\n3.1.1.2 However non-standard KCC /crop loans as defined and as per prevailing practices of the concerned\nBanks/Govt. regulator shall not be covered compulsorily. However bank branches may facilitate such\nfarmers for enrolment as non-loanee farmers .\n3.1.1.3 Merely, sanctioning of crop loan against other collateral securities including fixed deposits, gold/jewel\nloans, mortgage loans etc. without having insurable interest of the farmer on the insurable land and\nnotified crops shall not be covered under the Scheme.\n3.1.2 Voluntary Component\n• The Scheme is optional for non-loanee farmers.\n• The insurance coverage will strictly be equivalent to sum insured/hectare, as defined in the Govt.\nnotification or /and on National Crop Insurance Portal multiplied by sown area for notified crop.\n3.1.3 Special efforts shall be made to ensure maximum coverage of SC/ ST/ Women farmers under the\nScheme. Further Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRIs) may be involved in extension and awareness\ncreation amongst farmers and obtaining feed-back of farmers about the implementation of the\nScheme\n3.1.4 The implementing Insurance Company selected as L1 will be responsible for taking necessary\nmeasures to ensure at least 10% incremental increase in coverage of non-loanee farmers. However\nother empanelled Insurance Companies which have participated in the bidding and are keen for\nenrolment of non loanee farmers in the cluster may also be allowed to enrol non-loanee farmers at L1\npremium rate. The interested companies have to inform their willingness in writing within seven days\nof finalisation of tender/issuance of work order to L1. It will however be the responsibility of all the\nInsurance Companies engaged in this process to ensure that duplicate enrolment does not happen in\nthe given cluster/district. Engaging companies other than L1 for enrolling non loanee farmers will be\ntaken up on a pilot basis in Districts notified by State Govt. They shall enrol non loanee farmers as per\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 3\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",

They shall be\nliable for payment of claims to such farmers.\n3.1.6 The exchange of information, co-witnessing of CCEs and sharing of yield data etc for the cluster by\nGovernment/NCIP will be limited to L1 Company only and it will be binding on other companies to\naccept it. However, the requisition for payment of Government subsidy in respect of non-loanee\nenrolled by them will be submitted directly to the Govt designated agency.\n4. Coverage of Crops\nI. Food crops (Cereals ,Millets and Pulses),\nII. Oilseeds\nIII. Annual Commercial / Annual Horticultural crops.\nIn addition for perennial crops, pilots for coverage can be taken for those perennial horticultural crops\nfor which standard methodology for yield estimation is available.\n5. Coverage of Risks and Exclusions\n5.1 Following stages of the crop risks leading to crop loss are covered under the Scheme. Addition of new\nrisks by the State Govt other than the one mentioned below, by the State Govt. is not permitted.\n5.1.1 Prevented Sowing/Planting/Germination Risk: Insured area is prevented from sowing/\nplanting/germination due to deficit rainfall or adverse seasonal/weather conditions.\n5.1.2 Standing Crop (Sowing to Harvesting): Comprehensive risk insurance is provided to cover yield losses\ndue to non-preventable risks, viz. Drought, Dry spell, Flood, Inundation, widespread Pests and Disease\nattack, Landslides, Fire due to natural causes ,Lightening, Storm, Hailstorm and Cyclone.\n5.1.3 Post-Harvest Losses: Coverage is available only upto a maximum period of two weeks from harvesting,\nfor those crops which are required to be dried in cut and spread / small bundled condition in the field\nafter harvesting against specific perils of Hailstorm, Cyclone, Cyclonic rains and Unseasonal rains.\n5.1.4 Localized Calamities: Loss/damage to notified insured crops resulting from occurrence of identified\nlocalized risks of Hailstorm, Landslide, Inundation, Cloud burst and Natural fire due to lightening\naffecting isolated farms in the notified area.\n5.1.5 Add-on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals: The States may consider providing\nadd-on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals wherever the risk is perceived to be\nsubstantial and is identifiable. Detailed protocol and procedure for evaluation of bids will be\nissued separately by GOI in consultation with Ministry of Environment and Forest and GIC Re.

The actuarial premium rates for add-on coverage should be sought in the bid\nitself from the Insurance Companies, however the add-on actuarial premium rate will be\nconsidered separately and shall not form part of evaluation of L1.\n5.1.6 General Exclusions: Losses arising out of war and nuclear risks, malicious damage and other\npreventable risks shall be excluded.\n5.1.7 State Govts./UTs ,in consultation with SLCCCI, can exclude any of the aforesaid perils listed above\nwhich is not prevailing in their State/UT\n5.1.8 Yield loss damage for localised calamities and post harvest losses will be assessed on the basis of\nindividual insured farm level and hence lodging of loss information by farmer/designated agencies\nis essential. For remaining risks losses are due to widespread calamities. Hence lodging of\ninformation for claims by insured farmers / designated agencies for such wise spread calamities is\nnot essential. Claims will be calculated based on the loss assessment report/average yield\nsubmitted by concerned State Govt.\n6. Preconditions for implementation of the Scheme\n6.1 States:\nIssuance of Notification by State Govt. / UT for implementation of the Scheme (PMFBY) will imply\ntheir acceptance of all provisions, modalities and guidelines of the Scheme. The main conditions\nrelating to PMFBY which are binding on States/UTs are as follows:\n6.1.1 Adoption of innovative technology especially Smart phones/ hand held devices for capturing conduct\nof CCEs through CCE-Agri App and use of NCIP platform for flow of information and auto\nadministration of the scheme\n6.1.2 State has to conduct requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) at the level of notified\ninsurance unit area;\n6.1.3 CCE based yield data will be uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal/submitted to Insurance\nCompany within the notified cut off date ;\n6.1.4 State/ UT will make necessary budgetary provision for premium subsidy based on fair estimates, at\nthe beginning of the crop season;\n6.1.5 To carry out pilot studies for improved yield estimations using technology.\n6.1.6 Department of State Govt. which was earlier looking after implementation of erstwhile National\nAgriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS)/ National Crop Insurance Programme (NCIP*) may be designated\nas Nodal Department for implementation of PMFBY. The State Level Coordination Committee on Crop\nInsurance (SLCCCI) which was overseeing implementation of NAIS and NCIP* may be authorized to\noversee implementation of PMFBY. The States/UTs which had not implemented the NAIS / NCIP* shall\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 5\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",

The present\ncomposition of SLCCCI may be strengthened by including representatives from State Horticulture\nDept., State Remote Sensing Application Centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Farmers’\nRepresentatives and empanelled Insurance Companies for implementing PMFBY. Chairman of SLCCCI\nmay co-opt representatives from other departments/agencies, if considered necessary.\n6.2 Insurance Company:\nEmpanelment of Insurance Companies and their participation for implementation of the Scheme\n(PMFBY) will imply their acceptance of all provisions, modalities and guidelines of the Scheme. The\nempanelled Insurance Companies have to deploy requisite infrastructure and resources for\nimplementation of PMFBY particularly for following identified major activities:\n6.2.1 To carry out Pilot study for leveraging new technology for effective implementation of Scheme in a\ntransparent manner,\n6.2.2 Deployment of requisite infrastructure to increase the outreach to rural farmers at their doorstep,\n6.2.3 Commitment for at least 10 % incremental increase in Non loanee coverage,\n6.2.4 Deployment of sufficient manpower to co-observe CCEs and allied activities and compulsory use of\nCCE Co-observation app,\n6.2.5 Allocation of requisite resources and commitment for advertisements, awareness generation and\ncapacity building of stakeholders about the Scheme. The detailed planning for the same should be\nsubmitted to Central and State Govt. in advance, before the start of each season.\n6.3 Submission of UID (AADHAAR) by farmer:\n6.3.1 Aadhaar has been made mandatory for availing Crop insurance from Kharif 2017 season onwards.\nTherefore, all banks are advised to mandatorily obtain Aadhaar number of their farmers and the same\napplies for non-loanee farmers enrolled through banks/Insurance companies/insurance\nintermediaries.\n6.3.2 Farmers not having Aadhaar ID may also enrol under PMFBY subject to their enrolment for\nAadhaar and submission of proof of such enrolment as per notification No. 334.dated 8th February,\n2017 issued by GOI under Section 7 of Aadhaar Act 2016(Targeted Delivery of Financial and other\nSubsidies, Benefits and Services). Copy of the notification may be perused on www.pmfby.gov.in. This\nmay be subject to further directions issued by Govt. from time to time.\n6.3.3 All banks have to compulsorily take Aadhaar/Aadhaar enrolment number as per notification\nunder Aadhaar Act before sanction of crop loan/KCC under Interest Subvention Scheme. Hence the coverage\nof loanee farmers without Aadhaar does not arise and such accounts need to be reviewed by the\nconcerned bank branch regularly.\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 6\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",
    "Information from document 'pdf5.pdf' (Page 12):\n7. Notification\n7.1 Procedure for Issuance of Notification by the States/UTs:\n7.1.1 Prior to the commencement of the Kharif season, preferably in the beginning of November of previous\nyear, meeting of SLCCCI should be convened for finalising various terms and conditions and calling of\nbids/issuance of the bid notice to all empanelled Insurance Companies for selection to implement the\nScheme during the bid/ risk period. State / UT Govt. should ensure the issuance of the notification and\nits circulation to all concerned agencies/ departments/ institutions at least one month in advance of\nthe commencement of the crop season incorporating all the essential details about insured crops,\nareas, Scale of Finance, Sum Insured, Threshold Yield at insurance unit (IU) level for notified crops,\nperiod of contract, bidder’s evaluation and selection methodology, premium rate for farmers, Govt.\nsubsidy along with seasonality discipline/ cut off date for each activity etc. Notification should be\nissued for at least one year to facilitate banks for deduction of premium for a year\n7.1.2 In order to have transparency and system driven approach for crop insurance implementation, all the\ndetails as mentioned in para 7.1.1 above need to be part of the Tender Document and State\nNotification and no modification in the terms and condition enumerated in the tender document shall\nbe allowed post tendering.\n7.1.3 Bidding annexures may be generated through Portal. Procedure and template are available on\nNational Crop Insurance Portal. Before floating the Tender, last 10 years yield data at\nnotified/available level and TY at notified unit should be uploaded on the Portal in the given template\nand should be made part of the Tender.\n7.1.4 Calculation of lowest weighted premium of district shall be based on the insured areas of notified\ncrops in each district during last year/season. However, in absence of insured area of last year/season\nfor all proposed crops or any crop, net sown area of that crop(s) will be considered for calculation of\nweighted premium of district. This data will be used for calculation of L1 only.\n7.1.5 Bidding shall be done through e-tendering and work order may be released within 2 weeks of the\nopening of the Tender.\n7.1.6 Depending on the risk profile, historical loss cost and cost benefit analysis for the proposed crop(s) in\ndistrict(s) of any cluster, if the State Government feels that the premium rate likely to be offered by\nbidding Insurance Companies would be abnormally high, then the State Govt. can fix a ceiling on\npremium rates for such crop(s) proposed to be included in the bidding evaluation for the bidding\nperiod. However, recourse to this ceiling provision may be done only in well justified cases and not as\na general practice. The ceiling premium rate may be derived based on statistical evaluation/actuarial\npremium analysis, loss cost, historical payout etc and name of such crop should be disclosed by State\nGovt. compulsorily in the tender document.\n7.1.7 In such cases where a ceiling has been indicated, State government must call financial bids in two step\nbidding or in two separate envelopes. First bid/envelop is for disclosing the premium rate offered by\neach participating Insurance Company for such ceiling crops and must be categorised under “Ceiling\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 7\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",

Time interval for opening of both bid/envelop should be compulsorily mentioned in the\nbidding documents and should preferably be on the same day. All participating Insurance Companies\nhave to submit the bid offer as per the procedure mentioned above.\n7.1.8 State Govt. shall first evaluate first envelop of the bid keeping in view the premium offered by each\nindividual participating Insurance company and if the risk propensity and weather susceptibility of the\ncrop and/or historical claim/loss data doesn’t support the actuarial rates offered by the participating\nInsurance Companies, such crop(s) may be dropped from the list of proposed crops for notification by\nthe State Government and evaluation for L1 bidder should be done strictly based on the rates offered\nfor left out/remaining crops. The second envelope shall be opened by the State Govt. only after\ndecision on dropping the proposed crops/or accepting the premium rates offered by participating\nInsurance companies has been taken by the State Govt. If State Govt decides not to drop all proposed\ncrop(s)/ few crops for which premium rate obtained in separate envelop of “Ceiling Premium Rate”\nfrom the bidding process, then L1 will be calculated by inclusion of premium offered for all\ncrops/remaining crops.\n7.1.9 States should avoid doing re-tendering as a general practice. Re-tendering may be held only in\nexceptional circumstances and only with the prior approval of GOI after submission of a request with\ndetailed reasons. GOI on its part will give its decision within 5 working days of the receipt of the\nrequest.\n7.1.10 States are required to compulsorily upload Meeting Notices, Tender Documents, Addendums,\nrequisite data and other relevant information on the National Crop Insurance Portal for faster\ncommunication and response. Accordingly the subsequent notifications, circulars, directives shall also\nbe uploaded on the Portal as and when issued for wider reach and circulation.\n7.1.11 All conditions proposed to be stipulated by State Govt. should be incorporated in bid document itself\nand no new condition should be included in the notification. In case ICs have any objection to any\nTender condition which is in conflict with guidelines, they can make a reference to State govt. with a\ncopy to GOI within 3 days of issuance of Tender\n7.1.12 L1 bidder will not be allowed to withdraw their bid after opening of bids/allotment of work. If L1\nbidder withdraws then financial loss, if any, to the State Govt. due to retendering /assignment of\nwork to others, due to increase in actuarial premium rate from previously declared L1 rate, shall be\nrecovered from the withdrawing L1 bidder.\n7.2 Notification of Crops, Areas and Implementing Agency (IA)\n7.2.1 The Scheme shall operate on the principle of “Area Approach” in the selected defined areas called\nInsurance Unit (IU). State Govt. /UT will notify crops and defined areas covered during the season in\naccordance with decision taken in the meeting of SLCCCI. State/UT Govt. should notify Village/Village\nPanchayat or any other equivalent unit as an insurance unit for major crops defined at District /\nTaluka or equivalent level. For other crops it may be a unit of size above the level of Village/village\nPanchayat.

The level and name of notified area of insurance unit\nmust be part of notification and should be provided at the time of bidding itself.\n7.2.5 In case State Govts/UT proposes to notify irrigated and un-irrigated areas under a crop separately,\nthey shall ensure that minimum CCEs are planned and conducted for irrigated and un-irrigated crops\nseparately in such areas. In addition, past yield data for requisite number of years will have to be made\navailable separately for both\n7.2.6 While notifying the crop(s) where a specific conversion factor is being used for reporting of yield such\nas in the case of rice/paddy etc, due care should be taken by the State Nodal Department to use the\nrelevant specific nomenclature for disclosure of Average Yield, Threshold Yield and Actual Yield while\nreleasing the Tender Document and submission of Yield data and CCE data for calculation of admissible\nclaims. Insurance Companies will also be responsible for prior scrutiny of Tender document.\nInformation/data provided in Tender document will be treated as final and in case of any error/\nmisreporting/disparity, State Govt. and Insurance Company will be equally liable for payment of\nadditional claims arising on account of it, if any.\n7.2.7 For the current season or subsequent seasons (in a multi-year contract), the States, if required, can\nnotify additional IUs or de-notify certain IUs subject to maximum deviation of 10% of already notified\nIUs for the crop within a district at the same premium rate, before the cut-off date for debit of\npremium. If the deviation is >10% or in case of addition of new crop, actuarial premium rate may be\nworked out either by calculation of weighted average premium rate as prevalent in contiguous\ndistricts or by applying appropriate loading on the existing premium rate. The rates for such crops will\nbe determined /verified by TSU and its decision will be binding on both States and ICs.\n7.2.8 States implementing PMFBY at Village/ Village Panchayat level for major crops shall be entitled for\n50% reimbursement of incremental expenses of CCEs and cost of smart phones/ improved\ntechnology from GOI.

The steps in g and h are compulsory.\n• Statistical analysis of the CCE yield data: Basic Statistical Parameters (Mean, Variance, CV, Range,\nStandard Error, etc.) Scatter plots, Test of Normality (Shapiro-Wilk test, Quartile- Quartile plot,\nWhiskers box plot, Skewness and Kurtosis, etc.). It also needs to be checked whether CCEs were\ndone using the proper sampling design. Village level crop area may also be checked to identify\nreasons for lower number of CCE.\n• Analysis of Weather Data: Weekly Rainfall Deviations (at least at block level) or at grid level using\ngridded or satellite based data, Dry-spell Occurrence, Temperature Anomaly, Soil Moisture Analysis\n(either from satellite or model data) and any other available weather parameters (related to crop\ncondition), either from ground or satellite data. Another rainfall based index, which can also be\nstudied, is Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). SPI can be developed using IMD gridded rainfall\ndata or NOAA CPC rainfall data. However, while using gridded data (either from satellite or ground\nstations), appropriate resolution should be used at appropriate level. For example, 0.25 degree\ndata should be used only at district level and not at block/village level. High resolution weather\ndata can also be sourced from weather companies.\n• Analysis of Long-term Yield Data: Previous 10 years’ yield data (at GP or Taluka level) analysis\nshould be carried out to assess the ups and downs. The analysis would include yield ranges, mean\nyield, standard deviation, and CV.\n• Analysis of Other collateral data: Other data or reports, which should be considered, include Crop\nWeather Watch Report, NSSO Supervised CCE data, FASAL programme crop reports, drought\nassessment reports prepared by MNCFC, Market arrivals and prices data for 2-3 years\n(http://agmarknet.gov.in/), crop condition data available on VEDAS platform\n(https://vedas.sac.gov.in/vedas/), Disaster maps available on Bhuvan platform, IMD weather\nbulletins, weather information/forecasts available on MOSDAC (https://www.mosdac.gov.in/),\netc.\n• Analysis of Vegetation Index from Satellite Data: The vegetation index, which can be used for this\npurpose are Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Wetness Index\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 34\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",
    "Information from document 'pdf5.pdf' (Page 40):\n(NDWI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition index (TCI), Vegetation Health\nIndex (VHI), Enhance Vegetation Index (EVI), etc. To derive these indices, satellite data of\nappropriate resolution should be used (Table 6).\nTable 6 : Types of resolution to be used for vegetation index derivation for different levels of\nanalysis\nLevel of Spatial Examples of Satellite/Sensor\nAnalysis Resolution\nto be used\nVillage level 5-10 m or Resourcesat 2/2A: LISS IV (5.8m), Sentinel 2:MSI (10 m); Rapid Eye (6.5\nbetter m); SPOT 5 HRG (5,10 m)\nBlock/Tehsil 10-30 m Resourcesat 2/2A: LISS III (23.5 m), Landsat 8: OLI (30 m); Sentinel 2:MSI\nlevel (10 m)\nDistrict level 50-100 m Resourcesat 2/2A: AWiFS (56 m); Proba V (100 m)\nHowever, wherever long-term satellite data is needed MODIS (250 m) data can be used, but it should\nnot be used for village level for information. Ideally for deriving crop specific vegetation indices, crop\nmaps should be overlaid on the data. Generally for few major crops, crop maps are prepared under\nFASAL project of DAC&FW. Crop maps can be generated using either optical or microwave remote\nsensing (SAR) data of appropriate resolution. Wherever, crop maps are not available, at least\nagricultural area map should be used. For assessing NDVI or NDWI deviation percentage, data of latest\n2-3 years should be used or at least data of a normal crop year should be used.\n• Crop Growth Modelling: Yield loss estimates can be made using crop simulation models such as\nDSSAT/ InfoCrop, etc. Remote sensing based semi-physical modelling approach can also be used\nfor crop growth analysis. However, care should be taken to use well calibrated and validated\nmodels and also models should be run in spatial at higher resolution, at least 5 km.\n• Identification of Outliers: All these above analyses can be used to check whether there was any\nreason for yield deviation as presented in the CCE data. Then a yield proxy map may be prepared.\nThe Yield proxy map can be derived from remote sensing vegetation indices (single or\ncombination of indices), crop simulation model output, or an integration of various parameters,\nwhich are related to crop yield, such as soil, weather (gridded), satellite based products, etc.\nWhatever, yield proxies to be used, it is the responsibility of the organization to record\ndocumentary evidence (from their or other’s published work) that the yield proxy is related to the\nparticular crop’s yield. Then the IU level yields need to be overlaid on the yield proxy map. Both\nyield proxy and CCE yield can be divided into 4-5 categories (e.g. Very good, Good, Medium, Poor,\nVery poor). Wherever there is large mismatch between yield proxy and the CCE yield (more than 2\nlevels), the CCE yield for that IU can be considered, as outliers.\n• Computing Yield for the Outliers: For the IUs, where the yield was considered as outlier, the yield\nmay be estimated by developing empirical models (statistically significant) between long-term\nyield data (at IU level or, if not available, higher administrative level) and weather and remote\nsensing based index data. Using these models, yield for the concerned year should be estimated.\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 35\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY\n\nThe following is a table with important data:\n| Level of\nAnalysis | Spatial\nResolution\nto be used | Examples of Satellite/Sensor |\n| Village level | 5-10 m or\nbetter | Resourcesat 2/2A: LISS IV (5.8m), Sentinel 2:MSI (10 m); Rapid Eye (6.5\nm); SPOT 5 HRG (5,10 m) |\n| Block/Tehsil\nlevel | 10-30 m | Resourcesat 2/2A: LISS III (23.5 m), Landsat 8: OLI (30 m); Sentinel 2:MSI\n(10 m) |\n| District level | 50-100 m | Resourcesat 2/2A: AWiFS (56 m); Proba V (100 m) |",
    "Information from document 'pdf5.pdf' (Page 41):\nThe final yield can be estimated as a combination of CCE Yield and model estimated. The\nweightage to be given to each estimate will depend upon the quality of each estimate (CCE or\nModel). Low weightage should be given to CCE not conducted properly (without photograph, geo\nlocation, proper sampling plan etc.). Similarly lower weightage to be given model estimates, if\nmodel is statistically not highly significant. Wherever, if the model was not statistically significant\nthe average of estimated yields of adjacent blocks should be used (Note: Each and every case may\nhave specific and special cause related to a problem and may not be considered as a reference for\nany other case.) Each time, the stage of the crop should be given prior importance e.g. 10 mm\nrainfall at vegetative stage and at harvest or post-harvest stage has different impacts; a small\namount rainfall having devastating wind-speed have different impact than high amount of rainfall\nhaving calm or no-wind. The Technical Agency needs to take into account all these factors to\nconsider each of the cases as an individual and special case.\n19.7.6 Time required for the analysis: The analysis needs to be completed by the concerned technical\nagency, within one month of receipt of all mentioned data from the Insurance Company and the State\nGovernment.\n19.7.7 Funds needed for the analysis: All the analysis will be carried out by the Technical Agency, with its\nexisting resources. However, if there is any need of procurement of priced data or services, this may\nbe funded by the concerned Insurance Agency or the State Government, whichever organization has\nbrought the dispute issue up to TAC.\n19.7.8 General Suggestions: Though this SOP identifies the procedure for yield dispute resolutions, in a long\nrun, it will benefit the scheme and the farmers, if there is no Dispute. Following suggestions are made\nto avoid dispute.\n• The States should conduct the CCEs following the standard procedure (proper sampling plan) and\ncollect the data using Smartphone based Android App\n• States need to pro-actively use technology for more accurate crop yield estimation\n• States should develop mechanism to resolve disputes at State level by technical support from State\nlevel organizations, such as Agricultural Universities, State Remote Sensing Centres, ICAR Centres\nlocated in the State, local IMD office, etc.\n• The Insurance Companies should proactively, get involved with the States for supervision of CCEs.\n• The Insurance Companies should more and more invest in use of technology to support the loss\nassessment.\n• There should be better coordination between the State and the Insurance Companies.\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 36\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",
    "Information from document 'pdf5.pdf' (Page 42):\n20. Use of Innovative Technologies\n20.1 To Rationalize CCEs: With availability of a number of satellites with high resolution imaging\ncapability orbiting the Earth, there is a great improvement in satellite remote sensing based products.\nIt has been reasonably proven that satellite based vegetation indices (such as, Normalized Difference\nVegetation Index, NDVI and Normalized Difference Wetness Index, NDWI) can help in demarcating the\ncropped areas into clusters on the basis of crop health. This feature can be successfully used to target\nthe CCEs within the Insurance Unit (IU). In other words, satellite imagery can help in ‘smart sampling’\n(stratified sampling) of CCEs. This will help in optimizing the number of CCEs, to make them\nrepresentative of different crop conditions. This is expected to reduce the total need of CCEs by about\n30-40% while maintaining similar accuracy. It will also give a more representative yield of the IU, as it\nwill consider all crop pixels (fields) within the IU and not just location of 4 CCEs. States can adopt this\ntechnique (of using satellite based remote sensing data for planning of Crop Cutting Experiments) in\ngenerating yield estimates while following digital protocol outlined in the preceding paragraphs. For\nusing satellite data for smart sampling, there is a need to generate specific crop map. MNCFC under\nthe FASAL project of the DAC&FW prepares crop maps for various crops, as mentioned in Section 25,\npara 25.4. These crop maps can be used for CCE planning. Vegetation Indices (NDVI and NWDI) need to\nbe computed for the cropped area. On the basis of Vegetation Index, the crop area can be categorized\ninto poor, medium, good and very good crop health strata. Within each stratum, CCE points should be\nselected randomly. Additionally, ground truthing within these IUs can be done in order to develop crop\nyield model to ascertain yield estimation of the crop and simultaneously can act as a\nreconciliation/verification tool of actual CCEs conducted on the field. This can be done in consultation\nwith MNCFC, NRSC (ISRO), SAC (ISRO), SRSC and IASRI. This Department has also been piloting such\nstudies, in this regard, for optimization/reduction of crop cutting experiments using technology.\n20.2 To remove Area Discrepancy in coverage: It is noticed that in some instances in States/districts,\narea insured is much more than area sown figures hence, compulsory use of RST/ satellite imagery,\ndigitization of land records needs to be done to minimize the area discrepancy. For this detailed\nprocedure has been laid down in section 25\n20.3 For Direct Yield Estimation\n20.3.1 For addressing the issue of reliability of CCEs in terms of their accuracy, representativeness and\ntimeliness, innovative technologies such as satellite remote sensing, drone, modeling, AWS/ARG, real\ntime transmission of data etc. should be utilized. This will ensure accurate assessment of yield and\ntimely payment of claims to farmers. Various studies carried out by national and international\norganizations, including MNCFC, NRSC, SAC, CCAFS, IRRI, IFPRI, World Bank, etc. have shown that the\nuse of satellite, weather, soil and crop data, along with images/video capture of crop growth at various\nstages and accurate sample CCE data collection can improve the yield data quality/ timeliness and\nsupport timely claim processing and payments.\n20.3.2 States, with the support of national centres as mentioned above, SRSC and SAUs, need to carry out\nadequate number of pilot studies for improved yield estimation using technology, as mentioned\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 37\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",
    "Information from document 'pdf5.pdf' (Page 43):\nabove, and small number of good quality CCEs. When a significant correlation is observed between\nremote sensing and weather estimated yield and yield estimated through CCEs, States and Insurance\nCompanies can use these technologies in estimating the crop yields at IU level, subject to the\nsatisfaction of both States and Insurance Companies about the accuracy of the yield estimates, to\nservice the claims.\n20.4 To improve Yield-data Quality and Timeliness\n20.4.1 It has been observed that the normall CCE process being followed by the State for estimating yield is\nlacking in reliability, accuracy and speed, which affects claim settlement. There is a need for real\ntime, good quality and reliable actual yield-data for which mandatory use of smart phones / hand held\ndevices has to be done for capturing images, location of the CCE and for online transmission of data on\nNational Crop Insurance Portal through CCEs Agri-app. RST using satellite and drones, weather data,\nmodel etc. may also be used for the purpose of increasing accuracy and speed of yield estimation\nthrough CCEs.\n20.4.2 The cost of using technology etc. for conduct of CCE process specially purchase of smart phones/ hand\nheld devices and use of technology (RST, Drone etc.) will be shared between Central Govt. and State\nGovts/ U.Ts on 50:50 basis, wherever necessary, subject to a cap on total funds to be made available by\nCentral Govt. for this purpose based on approximate cost of procuring handheld devices/smart phones\nand other related costs (RST, Drone, etc).\n20.5 Technology Fund: A technology fund will be created by GOI wherein resources shall be allocated for\nmeeting 5% of GOI share/100% grant in various technological interventions undertaken by State Govt.\nfunds as admissible. The fund shall be augmented with excess farmers share of premium surrendered\nby Insurance Company due to application of ACF and penalties imposed on Insurance Companies on\naccount of poor performance by Insurance Companies as per the parameters outlined in Annexure 2\n21. Assessment of Claims\n21.1 Wide Spread Calamities\n21.1.1 If ‘Actual Yield’ (AY) per hectare of insured crop for the insurance unit (calculated on basis of requisite\nnumber of CCEs) in insured season, falls short of specified ‘Threshold Yield’ (TY), all insured farmers\ngrowing that crop in the defined area are deemed to have suffered shortfall of similar magnitude in\nyield. PMFBY seeks to provide coverage against such contingency.\n‘Claim’ shall be calculated at IU level as per the following formula:\n(Threshold Yield – Actual Yield)\n——————————————— X Sum Insured\nThreshold Yield\nWhere Threshold Yield (TY) for a crop in a notified insurance unit is the average yield of best 5 years\nfrom past seven years of that season multiplied by applicable Indemnity Level for that crop\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 38\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",

    "Information from document 'pdf5.pdf' (Page 62):\n25. Acreage discrepancy\n25.1 Some areas in the past have reported excess insurance coverage vis-à-vis planted acreage, leading to over-\ninsurance. Ideally the discrepancy should be handled at farm level to protect the interest of farmers\nwith genuine insurance coverage. All suitable measures are being taken by concerned stakeholders for\nde duplication with the help of Aadhaar Number, land records, banks records, revenue records and\nproposal/loan application of insured farmers. The details of individual insured farmers are being\ncollected on National Crop Insurance Portal for de duplication. However, in the absence of digitized\nfarm records on a GIS platform and its integration with the Portal, it would be cumbersome to\nphysically verify each farm when the reported discrepancies are comparatively large compared to the\nsown areas. Moreover, the scheme also covers the risk of prevented sowing/germination failure which\nis not being included in sowing areas furnished by the State Government for arriving of sown area of\ncrop the during the season. State wise List of such major crops will be notified by DAC&FW in\nconsultation with MNCFC from time to time before beginning of every season.\n25.2 Under the scheme, notified crops are being insured by the Insurance companies on the basis of\nactuarial premium rate, hence, it is not their prerogative to reduce the Sum Insured and resultant\nclaims on the application of ACF. However, to rationalize the government subsidy, it the\nresponsibilities of all concerned stakeholders including farmers and financial institutions to insured the\ncrop which farmer actually intend to sow/actually sown. Option to change the insured crop has also\nbeen provided under the scheme for reporting of crop(s) actually sown for the insurance. There is\nalso a provision to indemnify the crop losses due to localized perils on the basis of survey of\nindividual plot/field under insured crops. Any wrong reporting of insured crops may lead to\nforfeiting of claims, if the crop actually sown and insured will be different.\n25.3 Area Discrepancy will be applied only to those major crops for which Normal area sown data at the\nBlock/Taluka level shall be provided by MNCFC based on the remote sensing data etc after factoring\nthe areas remains unsown and failed germination/plantation due to adverse climatic conditions and\nshall be made available on National Crop Insurance Portal. No other data from any source including\nState Govt. will be considered.\n25.4 However, any mass irregularities/anomalies in insuring of excess area i.e. more than the published\ncultivable area at Taluka level should compulsorily be brought to the notice of DAC&FW, in writing\nafter cut off date of enrolment but before the period specified for reconciliation with banks along with\nfacts/documents and list of bank branches etc so that the same may be examined by the Government\nand rectified by concerned bank itself before finalisation of business Statistics for the season on Portal\n25.5 Decision of GOI in applicability of discrepancy in insured area shall be binding on all.\n25.6 If the difference between insured area and sown area provided by MNCFC is >30% at Block/Tehsil/\nTaluka , all IUs of such Block/Tehsil/ Taluka will fall under acreage discrepancy category and should be\ntreated as having ‘excess’ insurance coverage.\n25.7 Data on application of ACF shall be uploaded on National Crop Insurance Portal.\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 57\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",

Empanelment and Selection of Insurance Companies\n31.1 Empanelment Criteria\n31.1.1 The Public Sector (AIC& others) and Private Sector General Insurance Companies empanelled by DAC\n& FW and selected by concerned State Govt. / Union Territory (UT) shall implement the PMFBY. The\nInsurance Companies mainly engaged in agriculture/rural insurance business and having adequate\nexperience, infrastructure, financial strength and operational capabilities are empanelled by DAC&FW.\nOnce Insurance Company has been empanelled by DAC &FW, it is considered as pre-qualified\ncompany to bid for the selection of Implementing Agency (IA) to undertake implementation of the\nScheme/Programme of DAC&FW.\n31.1.2 L1 bidder shall not be permitted to surrender partial clusters/districts. If any Insurance Company declines\nafter being declared L1, it will be de-empanelled/ de-barred to implement crop insurance Scheme for\nthe coming/next season(s) in the concerned State and L2 may be given the cluster for implementing\nthe crop insurance Scheme at L1 district-crop combination rates and so on to L3, L4 bidder with their\nconsent. All Such bidders will be required to simultaneously furnish appropriate reasons for\nwithdrawal/surrender/non acceptance in writing to State Govt. with copy to DAC&FW to enable further\ncorrective measures and appropriate administrative & legal action accordingly. Financial losses, if any, to\nthe State Govt., in retendering due to withdrawal of selected bidders, will be recovered from withdrawing\nL1 bidder.\n31.1.3 Tender should be preferably for 3 years and in no case less than 1 year\n31.1.4 Each Insurance Company should compulsorily bid for any 3 NER/Hilly States and 2 UTs\n31.2 Selection Criteria of Insurance Companies as Implementing Agency (IA)\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 61\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",

Selection of IA will be made by adopting the cluster approach. In case of smaller\nStates, the whole State may be assigned to one IA.\n31.2.2 Before the commencement of the crop season, State Govt. would invite the pre-qualified companies\nas mentioned in the preceding para through open tender for submission of district-wise and crop-\nwise actuarial premium rates in percentage of Sum Insured (financial bid). Indemnity Level,\nThreshold Yields, Sum Insured etc. will be same for all Insurance Companies for the season. The\nempanelled companies participating in bidding have to bid the premium rates for all the crops notified\n/ to be notified in the cluster by the State Govt. and non-compliance will lead to rejection of the bid.\n31.2.3 Based on the district-wise and crop-wise actuarial premium rates quoted by the pre-qualified\ncompanies, the total premium amount and weighted average premium rates for cluster of districts will\nbe worked out to arrive at L1. L1 Bidder will be selected to act as Implementing Agency in the\nconcerned cluster.\n31.2.4 Selection of IA may be made for at least 1 year or up to three years as mentioned above Such long\nterm continuity will facilitate the Insurance Company to establish the credibility among the farmers\nthrough investment out of the premium savings in various welfare activities for socio-economic\ndevelopment of the farmers like creation of the facilities of drinking water/ healthcare/education,\nfarm levelling, Weather Forecasts, CSCs etc. It is also anticipated that long term continuity gives an\nopportunity to Insurers, Bankers, State Govt. and other stakeholders for a supportive and collaborative\ninteraction and business relationship and service effectiveness.\n31.2.5 The insurance coverage in terms of number of farmers and acreage should be at least at the level of\ncorresponding previous season. In case of fall in coverage, GOI may get the facts examined and\nnecessary action including penal action against negative points in ranking for ICs and State Govt., if\nfound at fault may be taken by GOI.\n31.2.6 State Govt. may provide requisite data about past yield data of last 10 consecutive years or more,\nthreshold yield, crop-wise sum insured, indemnity level, insurance unit levels, names of notified units,\ncalamity years etc. in digital form by uploading the same on National Crop Insurance Portal itself\nbefore floating the formal tender notice.\n32. Clustering /clubbing of districts for bidding by the State\nIn order to diversify/ spread the risk and cover high risk/ low risk districts/ area equally, the State\nGovernment are required to group the districts/ area in such a way that each group contains mix of\ndistricts/ area with different risk profiles. Prior to inviting the bid, the State Government specially large\nState have to divide the State in to multiple clusters of districts depending upon volume of risk\nassociated in the crops and district/areas proposed to be notified under the Scheme. The purpose of\nclustering is to divide the States into different groups of districts, so that expected sum insured (ESI)\nbecomes low and risk is shared and diversified. States may form the clusters of districts based on\nwww.pmfby.gov.in 62\nRevised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY",
    "Information from document 'pdf5.pdf' (Page 68):\nmixed agro-climatic zones. i) Districts of high risk and low risk areas, ii) districts of different agro-\nclimatic zones, and iii) ESI is of each cluster should be of similar order.\nPrior to the bid invitation, details on the clusters formation may also be made available to the\nInsurance Companies.\nThe object of Clustering/ Clubbing of districts should be done to achieve the following objectives:\n• Cluster formation may be applicable for upto 3 years.\n• Different Clusters may be defined based on risk profile of the district so as to increase the\ndiversification of risk within a cluster and enable risk spreading for insurer.\n• Cluster may contain districts with mixed agro-climatic zones so as to increase the diversification of\nrisk within a cluster.\n• Crop wise associated risk may also be diversified among the clusters and shall be factored in\ncluster formation.\n1. Hence, one of the major requirements of clustering is risk analysis of different districts. As per 2016\nGuidelines of PMFBY, for the purpose of clustering/clubbing of districts and determination of L1\nbidder, the risk is analyzed based on long term data of yield by (a) computing average burn cost\n(percent difference between actual yield and threshold yield) and b) computing the level of variability\nin long term yield. Since, availability of high quality long term yield data is difficult, especially at lower\nadministrative level, other methods (including use of satellite data) can be tried for risk assessment.\n2. Satellite data, of moderate resolution (e.g. Resourcesat AWiFS, Terra/Aqua MODIS) are available, for\nlong term, i.e. at least around 15 years. The long term Vegetation Indices, which are indicators of crop\nhealth, derived from these satellites can be used to assess the year to year variations and thereby\nunderstanding the risk potential of an area. It can be combined with many other satellite derived\nproducts, such as flood maps, drought assessments and vulnerability and long term weather data to\ncarry out the risk analysis. States are advised to take the support of concerned national or State level\nresearch organizations (e.g. ISRO- NRSC/SAC, MNCFC, SRSC, SAUs, etc.), to use the above mentioned\ntechnology for carrying out risk analysis of the Districts/ Talukas/ Blocks towards improvement in\nclustering.\n3. These are only for guidance of States and States are free to follow either of these or any other method\ndevised by them with intimation to DAC&FW.\n4.

National Crop Insurance Portal for administration of Crop\nInsurance Program (www.pmfby.gov.in)\n36.1 The Govt. is endeavouring to integrate all stakeholders’ viz. farmers, Insurance Companies,\nfinancial institutions and Govt. agencies on single IT platform to ensure better administration,\ncoordination and transparency for getting real time information and monitoring in a phased manner.\n36.2 The idea behind developing a web-based, integrated IT solution is to speed up service delivery, unify\nfragmented databases, achieve a single view of data, eliminate manual processes and thus provide\nfaster insurance services to farmers. DAC&FW has designed a web Portal for crop insurance\n(www.pmfby.gov.in) and is doing further enhancements to provide a single IT enabled platform for\ndigitization of processes and information data bank and dissemination mechanism, automation of\nadministrative procedures, premium and claim calculation and remittance etc. This IT driven system is\nenvisaged to address the issues which affect the current system of programme administration and thereby\nreduce its efficacy and lead to denial/ delay in benefit transfer to farmers viz. selective/layered information\naccess, manual interventions, multi-step procedures, documentary evidence/proofs, delayed/defective\ninformation sharing. Hence, integration of IT platforms of banks, Insurance Companies, State Govts. and\nyield/weather data providers with National Crop Insurance Portal directly or through interface for fetching\nin information is felt essential to avoid errors for timely transmission of requisite information amongst\nmajor stakeholders, early settlement of claims, proper monitoring and transparent administration of the\nSchemes. Once the entire linking of IT platforms of all stakeholders with the Web Portal is established, it\nwould also lead to faster processing of claims due to electronic flow of information. Currently, this Portal is\navailable in two languages – Hindi and English and it will be converted into all regional languages.\n36.3 The aforesaid Portal will provide an integrated ecosystem to streamline the process and to automate\nadministrative functions. A web-based, integrated IT solution has been developed which has opened a\nwindow of opportunity to remote and economically-weak farmers to benefit from crop insurance\nservices.\n36.4 The conceptualisation and development of web-portal has already been completed and launched\nhowever development and integration of futuristic technologies and enhancements as defined below\nare envisaged to be initiated in coming months.\n36.4.1 Payment of Premium and Remittance of Claims through Payment Gateway: All premium remittance\nfrom Farmers/Banks/Intermediaries and claim remittance from Insurance Companies will be routed\nthrough the Portal using payment gateway Pay-Gov. The facility is envisaged to address reconciliation\nof funds and bring swiftness and transparency in claim settlement.\n36.4.2 Integration of National Crop Insurance Portal with IT infrastructure of Insurance Company: For\nseamless and real-time data flow of following stages to the Insurance Companies, direct integration of\nNational Crop Insurance Portal with the IT system of respective Insurance Companies will be\nestablished.

The\nsame digitized land records will be mapped with the codes used in National Crop Insurance Portal\nfollowed by online integration of the individual land records with the crop insurance application. This\nfacility will address the issue of excess insurance/double insurance and application of ACF which is\nprevalent currently.\n36.4.4 Integration of Weather Data with the Portal: Weather Data procured from a network of Automatic\nWeather Stations and Automatic Rain Gauges across the country will be procured from IMD and\nintegrated with the National Crop Insurance Portal. This will enable real-time monitoring of weather\nparameters, agro-climatic inputs, crop health monitoring, triggers for preventive sowing/mid-term\nadversities etc. This integration will also facilitate faster, transparent transmission of yield/weather\ndata to concerned Insurance Companies and automated claim calculation and remittance to\nbeneficiaries. This feature will ensure availability of real-time information about crop loss and payable\nclaims vis-a-vis necessary triggers/inputs to Govt. agencies/Implementing agencies so that policy\ndecisions/administrative corrective measures can be taken.\n36.4.5 Integration of Public Grievance Redressal Module: For bringing efficiency in addressing the grievances\nof farmers and other stakeholders, a system for registration of complaints and grievances, escalations\nand resolution will be integrated with the Portal.\n36.4.6 Launch of National Help Line and Integration with Web-Portal: A quick response system is very\ncrucial for creating trust and bringing behavioural changes and efficiency amongst the stakeholders.\nKeeping the same in view, an integrated help line of Kisan Call Center will be launched for benefit of all\nthe stakeholders for query resolution, technical handholding and specific information dissemination.\n36.4.7 Development of Mobile-App for Localized/Individual, Preventive/Mid-Term Loss Assessment and\nreporting: For bringing in swiftness and accuracy in the information sharing and reporting of\nLocalized/Individual, Preventive/Mid-Term Losses, a mobile application will be launched for use of loss\nassessors/DLMC members. This data collected through app will be immediately sent to National Crop\nInsurance Portal which will be accessed by all the stakeholders.

On the basis of the variation in agriculture output (crops) in each district during the last\n10 years, districts may be divided in to three categories of low, moderate and high risks to agriculture.\nIf variation in agriculture output in the district during the last 10 years worked out to be plus\nminus<15% then district may be categorized as low risk. Similarly, districts of variation ranging plus\nminus 16-30% may be categorized of moderate risks and variation of plus minus >30% as high risks\ndistricts to agriculture operations. Accordingly all districts of the State would be identified as\nlow/moderate/high risk. Number of clusters to be formed shall be decided according to total no. of\ndistricts in the State.

    "Information from document 'pdf7.pdf' (Page 5):\nOperational Guidelines for Central Sector Scheme for Promotion of National\nAgriculture Market (NAM) through Agri-Tech Infrastructure Fund (ATIF).\n1. Introduction:\n1.1 Following successive Budget announcements of 2014-2015 and 2015-16 on setting up an “Agri-\nTech Infrastructure Fund” and the need to create a National Agriculture Market to increase the\nincome of farmers with incidental benefit of moderating price rise respectively, Government\napproved a Central Sector Scheme for “Promotion of National Agriculture Market (NAM)\nthrough Agri-Tech Infrastructure Fund (ATIF) on 01st July, 2015 with a budget allocation of Rs.\n200 crore. The scheme envisages deployment of a common e-market platform in 585 selected\nregulated wholesale agriculture markets (hereinafter called markets) by March, 2018. The\ncommon e-market portal will be called e-NAM.\n2. Objectives:\nThe main objectives of the Scheme are -\n(i) to integrate markets first at the level of the States and eventually across the country\nthrough a common online market platform, to facilitate pan - India trade in agricultural\ncommodities;\n(ii) to streamline marketing / transaction procedures and make them uniform across all\nmarkets to promote efficient functioning of the markets;\n(iii) to promote better marketing opportunities for farmers / sellers through online access\nto more buyers / markets, removal of information asymmetry between farmer and\ntrader, better and real-time price discovery based on actual demand and supply of agri-\ncommodities, transparency in auction process, prices commensurate with quality of\nproduce, online payment etc. that contribute to marketing efficiency;\n(iv) to establish quality assaying systems for quality assurance to promote informed bidding\nby buyers; and\n(v) to promote stable prices and availability of quality produce to consumers.\n3. Scheme design:\n3.1 NAM is envisaged as a pan-India electronic trading portal, to be managed centrally by a lead\nimplementing agency i.e. Small Farmers’ Agribusiness Cconsortium (SFAC), which will network\n585 selected markets in a span of three years (2015-16 to 2017-18) to create a unified national\nmarket for agricultural commodities. NAM is a “virtual” market but it has a physical market at the\nback end. While one time registration of farmers / sellers, lot details at the entry gate, weighment,\nquality assaying, auctions / trade transactions, payment by buyers to sellers and other agencies\ninvolved in the chain of transaction will take place online on e-NAM, actual material flow will\nhappen physically through the market. Entire arrivals of agricultural commodities selected for\ntrading on e-NAM will be traded on-line only.\nOperational Guidelines for Promotion of National Agriculture Market (NAM) | 1\n\nThe following is a table with important data:\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |",

Eligibility criteria for availing assistance under the scheme:\n4.1 The scheme being linked to agricultural marketing reforms, the States / Union Territories (UTs)\nneed to undertake mandatory reforms in their Agriculture Produce Market Committee ( APMC)\nActs in respect of following three areas to avail the assistance under it -\n(i) single trading license to be valid across the State;\n(ii) single point levy of market fee across the State; and\n(iii) provision for e-auction / e-trading as a mode of price discovery to be facilitated by the State\nAgriculture Marketing Department / Board / APMCs / Regulated Market Committees\n(RMCs), as the case may be.\n4.1.1 In respect of 4.1 (i) above, State/UT must provide, through appropriate legislation /\nexecutive order in consonance with the concerned APMC Act / regulation, for issue of\nsingle trade license to any eligible person from across India irrespective of one’s domicile\nto enable one to trade through e-NAM portal in the markets across the State / UT.\nFurther, State / UT must provide for a liberal process of single trade license for wholesale\ntraders / buyers for the entire State & ensure that there are no barriers like prohibitively\nhigh security deposits or stipulations regarding minimum quantities to be transacted or\nrequirements of establishment of purchase centre / premise’ etc.\n4.1.2 In respect of 4.1 (ii) above, State / UT must provide, through appropriate legislation /\nexecutive order in consonance with the concerned APMC Act / regulation for single\npoint levy of market fee for wholesale trading of same produce across the State i.e., levy\nof market fee / cess at point of first transaction only in the State.

The\nentity so identified may develop the appropriate physical infrastructure required for e-trading\non e-NAM at back end and provide required logistic support. Regulatory framework / legally\nbacked guidelines may include all the required facilitatory provisions for trading on e-NAM\nportal including enlisting / registration of traders / buyers, transaction fee etc.\n4.5 The proposals of private markets for providing access to e-NAM portal may also be considered\nby the Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) provided they are recommended by the competent\nauthority of the concerned State / UT. However, in such cases they must provide for mandi\nanalyst, related hardware, assaying facilities and other support services at their own cost.\n5.

Today, what are generally referred to as Third‐Party\nCertification systems have become the dominant means of Organic Guarantee for world trade\nand Indian producers have accredited Third‐Party Organic Certification agencies to choose\nfrom. While Third Party Certification is an essential component to world trade, there are\ndownsides to the system. The inherent expense and paperwork required in a multi‐level\nsystem discourages most small organic producers from being certified at all. This limits local\nand domestic trade as well as access to organic products. Worse yet, it limits the growth of\nthe Organic Movement as a whole.\nIn an attempt to reduce the inequality, a number of alternative methods to guarantee the\nOrganic integrity of products have been developed for small domestic producers, and they are\ngrowing rapidly. These alternative programs are now collectively referred to as Participatory\nGuarantee Systems (PGS). The term PGS embodies the active participation of producers and\nother stakeholders in their organic guarantee process.\n1.2 About PGS\nParticipatory Guarantee System (PGS) is a quality assurance initiative that is locally relevant,\nemphasize the participation of stakeholders, including producers and consumers and operate\noutside the frame work of third party certification. As per IFOAM (2008) definition\n\"Participatory Guarantee Systems are locally focused quality assurance systems. They certify\nproducers based on active participation of stakeholders and are built on a foundation of trust,\nsocial networks and knowledge exchange”. PGS is a process in which people in similar\nsituations (in this case small holder producers) assess, inspect and verify the production\npractices of each other and take decision on organic certification (PGS-Green and PGS-\nOrganic ).\nPGS system has number of basic elements which embrace a participatory approach, a shared\nvision, transparency and trust. Participation is an essential and dynamic part of PGS. Key\nstakeholders (producers, consumers, retailers, traders and others such as NGOs, Societies/\nGram panchayaths/ State/Central Govt. organization/agencies /farmer etc.,) are engaged in\nthe initial design, and then in the operation of the PGS. In the operation of a PGS,\nstakeholders (including producers) are involved in decision making and essential decisions\nabout the operation of the PGS itself. In addition to being involved in the mechanics of the\nPGS, stakeholders, particularly the producers are engaged in a structured ongoing learning\nprocess, which helps them improve what they do. This process is facilitated by the PGS\ngroup itself or in some situations a supportive NGO/ Societies, Gram panchayaths,\nState/Central Govt. organization/agencies etc. The learning process is usually „hands-on‟ and\ninvolves field days or workshops.

In addition it gives\nPGS movement a National recognition and institutional structure without affecting the spirit\nof PGS.\n1.3.1 Participation\nParticipation is an essential and dynamic part of PGS. Key stakeholders (producers,\nconsumers, retailers, traders and others such as NGOs, Societies, Gram panchayaths,\nState/Central Govt. organization/agencies etc., ) are engaged in the initial design, and then in\nthe operation of the PGS and decision making.\nThe idea of participation embodies the principle of a collective responsibility for ensuring the\norganic integrity of the PGS. This collective responsibility is reflected through:\n• Shared ownership of the PGS\n• Stakeholder engagement in the development process\n• Understanding of how the system works and\n• Direct communication between producers and consumers and other stakeholders,\nproducers, consumers, retailers, traders and others such as NGOs, Societies, Gram\npanchayaths, State/Central Govt. organization/agencies etc.\nTogether these help to shape the integrity based approach and a formula for trust. An\nimportant tool for promoting this trust is having operational processes that are\ntransparent. This includes transparency in decision making, easy access to the data base\nand where possible farms are open to participation and visits of consumers. Participation\nof traders/ retailers or consumers in decision making may not be possible under all\nsituations, but their participation in any form will increase the credibility and\ntrustworthiness of the group.\n1.3.2 Shared Vision\nCollective responsibility for implementation and decision making is driven by common\nshared vision. All the key stakeholders (producers, consumers, retailers, traders and others\nsuch as NGOs, Societies, Gram panchayaths, State/Central Govt. organization/agencies etc.)\nsupport the guiding principles and goals, PGS is striving to achieve.

These will be available through a dedicated National database websites(PGS-INDIA\nwebportal). But still it does not mean that entire information on National PGS database will\nbe available to everyone.\n\nThe following is a table with important data:\n| 1.3 Guiding Principles for Participatory Guarantee System |  |  |\n| In tune with the international trends and IFOAM‟s PGS Guidelines, PGS India system is also |  |  |\n| based on participatory approach, a shared vision, transparency and trust. In addition it gives |  |  |\n| PGS movement a National recognition and institutional structure without affecting the spirit |  |  |\n| of PGS. |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n| 1.3.1 Participation |  |  |\n| Participation is an essential and dynamic part of PGS. Key stakeholders (producers, |  |  |\n| consumers, retailers, traders and others such as NGOs, Societies, Gram panchayaths, |  |  |\n| State/Central Govt. organization/agencies etc., ) are engaged in the initial design, and then in |  |  |\n| the operation of the PGS and decision making. |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n| The idea of participation embodies the principle of a collective responsibility for ensuring the |  |  |\n| organic integrity of the PGS. This collective responsibility is reflected through: |  |  |\n|  |  | • Shared ownership of the PGS |\n|  |  | • Stakeholder engagement in the development process |\n|  |  | • Understanding of how the system works and |\n| • Direct communication between producers and consumers and other stakeholders, |  |  |\n| producers, consumers, retailers, traders and others such as NGOs, Societies, Gram |  |  |\n| panchayaths, State/Central Govt. organization/agencies etc. |  |  |\n|  | Together these help to shape the integrity based approach and a formula for trust. An |  |\n|  | important tool for promoting this trust is having operational processes that are |  |\n|  | transparent. This includes transparency in decision making, easy access to the data base |  |\n|  | and where possible farms are open to participation and visits of consumers. Participation |  |\n|  | of traders/ retailers or consumers in decision making may not be possible under all |  |\n|  | situations, but their participation in any form will increase the credibility and |  |\n|  | trustworthiness of the group. |  |\n|  |  |  |\n| 1.3.2 Shared Vision |  |  |\n| Collective responsibility for implementation and decision making is driven by common |  |  |\n| shared vision. All the key stakeholders (producers, consumers, retailers, traders and others |  |  |\n| such as NGOs, Societies, Gram panchayaths, State/Central Govt. organization/agencies etc.) |  |  |\n| support the guiding principles and goals, PGS is striving to achieve. This can be achieved |  |  |\n| initially through their participation and support in the design and then by joining it. This may |  |  |\n| include commitment in writing through signing an application/ document that includes the |  |  |\n| vision. |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n| Each stakeholder organization (or PGS group) can adopt its own vision conforming to the |  |  |\n| overall vision and standards of PGS- India programme. |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n| 1.3.3 Transparency |  |  |\n| Transparency is created by having all stakeholders, including producers and consumers, |  |  |\n| aware of exactly how the guarantee system works to include the standards, the organic |  |  |\n| guarantee process (norms) with clearly defined and documented systems and how decisions |  |  |\n| are made.

LGs shall provide full access to all the documents, records and information, including |  |\n| their fields and members for surveillance, monitoring and groups‟ competence assessment |  |\n| to representatives of RCs, Zonal Councils or PGS-India Secretariat at any point of time |  |\n| during their visits. |  |\n|  |  |\n| 16. LGs shall ensure mutual recognition and support among different LGs at regional and |  |\n| national level by studying each other‟s processes and functioning and by having |  |\n| surveillance in each other‟s areas. |  |\n|  |  |\n| 17. In case if any LG wanted to leave and desire to join other RC, then the group need to |  |\n| apply to the concerned RC or in case if RC is not cooperating then to Zonal Council for |  |\n| No Objection Certificate with full reason and justification. On being satisfied RC/ ZC can |  |\n| allow LGs to join other RC. In such cases after obtaining NOC from RC/ ZC, they can |  |\n| apply for registration to other RC with a copy of NOC. Entire record pertaining to that |  |\n| group shall be transferred to the new RC on their request without any prejudice or |  |\n| condition, what-so-ever. |  |\n|  |  |\n| 18. AS PGS-India programme do not provide for part conversion and parallel production, RC |  |\n| shall ensure that all LGs stick to these requirements and in case where phased conversion |  |\n| is allowed, proper time schedule of full conversion is chalked out and approved. LGs |  |\n| need to ensure that approved time frame is adhered. In cases where a group or a member |  |\n| of the group fails to meet the requirement of full conversion, he will not be entitled for |  |\n| organic certification, in spite of being attaining full requirements of organic on part fields. |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |",

Ensure that members have committed to convert their entire land holding and\nlivestock to organic. In case if some members propose to convert their land in\nphases then draw appropriate strategies to distinctly separate such units with\norganic ones. Also chalk out a plan for phased conversion and get it approved by\nRegional Council. As per PGS-India norms each member has to bring his entire\nland holding with livestock within 24 months from the date of registration in the\ngroup.\nIf a farmer under PGS-India group fails to convert his entire land\nholding and livestock within the stipulated 24 months time, then he\nwill not be eligible for PGS organic certification and shall continue to\nremain under conversion.\nxxxv. Invite already registered another Local Group to verify the group formation and\nobtain necessary recommendations. In case if there is no other PGS-LG close by,\nthen contact local State Agriculture office, demonstrate the group‟s strength on\norganic and obtain endorsement. Alternatively apply to the RC and request RC to\nundertake verification. RCOFs can also be requested for endorsement of Local\nGroups.\nThe Local Groups need to be approved only once and no further\nrenewal is needed. If there are repeated problems (missing\npaperwork, a random pesticide inspection turns up a problem, a\nrandom oversight inspection turns up a problem, etc) THEN they\ncould get disbanded/ sanctioned and have to re-apply and could get\nre-entry only after taking necessary correction and thorough\nverification by RC.\nxxxvi. Register the group on-line on PGS Website. In case if the group do not have\naccess to computer and internet, then services of an local computer operator/\ninternet cafe can be taken. Alternatively fill all the forms and submit to RC for\nuploading the information on PGS website.\nxxxvii.

Government is committed\nto giving high priority to water security. It will complete the long pending\nirrigation projects on priority and launch the ‘Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee\nYojana’ with the motto of ‘Har Khet Ko Paani’. There is a need for seriously\nconsidering all options including linking of rivers, where feasible; for ensuring\noptimal use of our water resources to prevent the recurrence of floods and\ndrought. By harnessing rain water through ‘Jal Sanchay’ and ‘Jal Sinchan’, we will\nnurture water conservation and ground water recharge. Micro irrigation will be\npopularised to ensure ‘Per drop-More crop’ .\nOut of about 141 m.Ha of net area sown in the country, about 65 million\nhectare (or 45%) is presently covered under irrigation. Substantial dependency\non rainfall makes cultivation in unirrigated areas a high risk, less productive\nprofession. Empirical evidences suggest that assured or protective irrigation\nencourages farmers to invest more in farming technology and inputs leading to\nproductivity enhancement and increased farm income.\nThe overreaching vision of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)\nwill be to ensure access to some means of protective irrigation to all agricultural\nfarms in the country, to produce ‘per drop more crop’, thus bringing much desired\nrural prosperity.\n2.0 Objectives:\nThe broad objectives of PMKSY will be:-\na) Achieve convergence of investments in irrigation at the field level\n(preparation of district level and, if required, sub district level water use\nplans).\nb) Enhance the physical access of water on the farm and expand cultivable\narea under assured irrigation (Har Khet ko pani),\nc) Integration of water source, distribution and its efficient use, to make best\nuse of water through appropriate technologies and practices.\nd) Improve on-farm water use efficiency to reduce wastage and increase\navailability both in duration and extent,\ne) Enhance the adoption of precision-irrigation and other water saving\ntechnologies (More crop per drop).\n\nThe following is a table with important data:\n| Hon’ble President in his address to the joint Session of the Parliament of 16thLok |\n| Sabha indicated that “Each drop of water is precious.

DIPs will identify the gaps in irrigation infrastructure\nafter taking into consideration the District Agriculture Plans (DAPs) already\nprepared for Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) vis-à-vis irrigation infrastructure\ncurrently available and resources that would be added during XII Plan from other\nongoing schemes (both State and Central), like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural\nEmployment Guarantee Scheme(MGNREGS), Rashtriya Krishi Vikash Yojana\n(RKVY), Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF), Member of Parliament\nLocal Area Development (MPLAD) Scheme, Member of Legislative Assembly Local\nArea Development (MLALAD) Scheme, Local body funds etc. The gaps indentified\nunder Strategic Research & Extension Plan (SREGP) will be made use in\npreparation of DIP.\nDIPs will present holistic irrigation development perspective of the district\noutlining medium to long term development plans integrating three components\nviz. water sources, distribution network and water use applications incorporating\nall usage of water like drinking & domestic use, irrigation and industry.\nPreparation of DIP will be taken up as joint exercise of all participating\ndepartments. DIP will form the compendium of all existing and proposed water\nresource network system in the district.\nThe DIPs may be prepared at two levels, the block and the district.\nKeeping in view the convenience of map preparation and data collection, the work\nwould be primarily done at block level. Block wise irrigation plan is to be prepared\ndepending on the available and potential water resources and water requirement\nfor agriculture sector prioritising the activities based on socio-economic and\nlocation specific requirement. In case of planning is made based on basin/sub\nbasin level, the comprehensive irrigation plan may cover more than one district.\nThe activities identified in the basin/sub-basin plan can be further segregated into\ndistrict/block level action plans. Use of satellite imagery, topo sheets and available\ndatabase may be appropriately utilised for developing irrigation plans at least on\npilot basis to begin with and subsequently may be extended to all projects. DPRs\nof watershed projects should be taken into account while preparation of DIPs.",

The master plan will include\ninformation on all sources of available water, distribution network, defunct water\nbodies, new potential water sources both surface and sub- surface systems,\napplication & conveyance provisions, crops and cropping system aligned to\navailable/designed quantity of water and suitable to local agro ecology. All\nactivities pertaining water harvesting, water augmentation from surface/sub\nsurface sources, distribution and application of water including repair renovation\nand restoration of water bodies, major medium and minor irrigation works,\ncommand area development etc. are to be taken up within the frame work of this\nmaster plan. Emphasis is to be given for deriving potential benefit from low\nhanging fruits like extending the reach/coverage of water source through effective\ndistribution and application mechanism, reducing the gap between potential\ncreated and utilized through more focus on command area development and\nprecision irrigation. Proper integration of creation of source like dams and water\nharvesting structures, distribution system like canals and command area\ndevelopment works and precision farming to be made for deriving best possible\nuse of water resources. Steps may also be taken for use of urban treated waste\nwater for irrigation purpose. For respective cities a command area may be\nidentified for this purpose in and around the adjoining agricultural land of urban\nhabitation. However, the recommended norms (given Appendix-C) of treated\nsewage quality for specified activities at point of use be ensured during use of\nrecycled water.\nSIP will not only consolidate the DIPs and correlate with State Agriculture\nPlan (SAP), already available for RKVY, but also prioritize resources and outline\ndefinite annual action plan with a medium to long term horizon. The plan would\nalso enumerate on extension & ICT related activities to be undertaken under\nsupervision of Agriculture Technology Management Agency (ATMA).\nDIPs and SIP will provide requisite emphasis on convergence by eliminating\noverlap of resources & efforts and ensuring optimal utilization of funds available",
    "Information from document 'pdf9.pdf' (Page 7):\nthrough various Centrally Sponsored/State Plan Schemes.\nEach District will be provided one time financial support to prepare District\nIrrigation Plan. DIPs and SIP are to be finalised within a period of three months\nfrom launching of PMKSY. National Rainfed Area Authority (NRAA) will be\nassociated in preparation of SIP and providing advisories to State Governments for\ncomprehensive irrigation development.\nWhile formulating District Irrigation Plans (DIPs), suggestions of Hon’ble\nMember’s of Parliament and Member’s of Legislative Assembly of that is to be\ninvited and will be included in DIPs after due technical consideration. Highest\npriority is to be given on valuable suggestions/recommendations of Member of\nParliament of that particular district subject to technical/financial viability.\n6.0 Cost Norm & Pattern of Assistance:\nTechnical requirements / standards, pattern of assistance etc. for activities of\nrespective components like AIBP, PMKSY (Har Khet Ko Pani), PMKSY (Per drop\nmore crop) and PMKSY (Watershed Development) will be as per the existing\nguidelines of the respective Ministries/Departments or as per revised norms\nincluding that of additional activities introduced, to be issued by the respective\nministries/departments with the approval of concerned Union Minister.\nIn the absence of equivalent Central Plan Scheme, norms and conditions\nprescribed by respective State Governments for their schemes may be applied.\nIn cases where no Central / State Govt. norms are available, a certificate of\nreasonableness of proposed project cost along with reasons thereof will invariably\nbe given by State Level Project Screening Committee (SLPSC) in each such case.\nStates should adhere to Govt. approved rate e.g. Schedule of rate of\nCPWD/PWD/Irrigation Dept or similar Govt. agencies working in rural areas, for\ncreation of irrigation infrastructure.\n7.0 Eligibility criteria:\nInstead of incremental budgeting, PMKSY will adopt a dynamic annual fund\nallocation methodology that mandates States to allocate more funds to irrigation\nsectors for becoming eligible to access PMKSY funds. For this purpose:\na) A State will become eligible to access PMKSY fund only if it has prepared the\nDistrict Irrigation Plans (DIP) and State Irrigation Plan (SIP), excepting for\nthe initial year, and the expenditure in water resource development for\nagriculture sector in the year under consideration is not less than baseline\nexpenditure.

During 2015-16, existing pattern of assistance of ongoing schemes\nwill be continued.\n9.0 Programme Architecture:\nPMKSY will be implemented in area development mode only by adopting a\n‘decentralized State level planning and projectised execution’ structure that will\nallow States to draw up their own irrigation development plans based on DIPs and\nSIPs with a horizon of 5-7 years. Initial phase of implementation will be the\nremaining two years of XII Plan.\nStates will allocate about 50% of the PMKSY funds by prioritizing projects\namong those districts having larger share of unirrigated areas, lesser agriculture\nproductivity vis-à-vis State’s average and higher population of SC/ST and Small &\nMarginal Farmers (SMF). States will also give priority to villages identified under\nSansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) while implementing PMKSY. The remaining\n50% may be prioritised for operationalising /saturating projects which are under\nterminal stage of completion (water resource development/watershed). Priority to\nalso be given for reducing the gap between irrigation potential created and\nactually utilised through command area development and precision irrigation.\nAs PMKSY will be a area-based scheme with projectised approach, Project\nReports will have to be prepared for each of the PMKSY component based on the\ncomprehensive irrigation plan incorporating all essential ingredients i.e. feasibility\nstudies, competencies of the implementing agencies, anticipated benefits\n(outputs/outcomes) that will flow to the farmers/ State, definite time-lines for",

In selected areas, few progressive\nfarmers may be sensitised towards this subject and incentivised to experiment\nwith changes in cropping pattern with available irrigation facilities. Farm school\ncomponent of ATMA scheme would be suitably used to take up this activity.\nCluster of 8 to 10 villages may be taken up in districts for saturating those as per\nthe plan for showcasing potential augmentation of water and its efficient use. The\nsuccess of these clusters in promoting such activities may be replicated in other\nparts of the district.\nExtending the reach of micro irrigation to a larger coverage will be ensured\ninvolving companies associated with precision irrigation for awareness campaign,\ndemonstration, capacity building training, providing maintenance service, technical\nsupport etc. A greater role of these companies will be specified in the operational\nguidelines of this component.\nThe success stories of indigenous practices like Jal mandir; Khatri; Kuhl;\nZabo Ooranis; Dongs; Katas; Bandhas etc., innovative projects, participatory\nmanagement etc. may be captured and documented for sharing with other states\nand agencies for wider replication.\n10.0 Nodal Department:\nSince, the final outcome of PMKSY is to ensure access to efficient delivery\nand application of water at every farm thereby enhancing agricultural production\n& productivity, State Agriculture Department will be the Nodal Department for\nimplementation of PMKSY.

States will be\nresponsible for timely submission/updating project data online in the system\n(preferably on a fortnightly basis), which will provide current and authenticated\ndata on outputs, outcome and contribution of PMKSY projects in the public\ndomain. Monitorable targets against each component will be fixed by concerned\nMinistry/department of GOI such as Department of Agriculture & Cooperation,\nMinistry of Water Resources, RD& GR, Department of Land Resources and Ministry\nof Rural Development for all sub-components (MoRD will enter the information\nonly for creation of water sources in the identified rainfed and backward blocks for\nspecial focus by MGNREGA funds where DoLR to complete their ongoing\nwatershed programmes). Any achievements in a given timeframe will be reported\nfor each activity with respect to baseline/historic data. This may include increase\nin production area, productivity, use of precision facilities etc. In this process, the\nfocus should also be on to fix accountability and use technology for not meeting\nthe targets and time frame of implementation.\nPMKSY-MIS reports shall be the basis of ‘on line monitoring’ and judging\n‘Inter-State performance’; States may establish a dedicated PMKSY-MIS cell for\nthis purpose.\nThe assets created under “Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sinchai Yojana” will be\ngeo-tagged and mapped on to location maps using Bhuvan application developed\nby Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). This activity will be dovetailed\nwith the new Innovative Technology Dissemination component of hand held\ndevices under NAMET. The extension workers or other verification authorities will\nfill in details of the asset being created or completed under the Scheme by\ncompleting online form as an Android application. Asset details of each irrigation\nsource and distribution channel with digitized satellite imagery with necessary\ninformation on capacity, sources, inlets, outlets etc. to be uploaded using geo-\ntagging feature of a GPS enabled smart phone. In order to fine-tune this activity,\nvillage boundaries as per Survey of India (having latitude/longitude details) will be\nused in conjunction with District/Block codes strictly in keeping with the Farmer’s\nPortal so as to avoid any duplication or contradiction. Each structure will have a\nunique ID no. with “first two letters of state/abbreviated scheme name/ first three\nletters of district/year of operationalization/ longitude/latitude”. Services of MNCFC\nwill be utilised for such activities.\nTwenty five percent (25%) of the projects sanctioned by the State shall\nhave to be compulsorily taken up for third party monitoring and evaluation by the\nimplementing States. Besides, the accounts of all this assets created will have to\nbe put before the Gram Sabha for social audit.\nAction plan for monitoring and evaluation will be chosen by SLSC every\nyear in its first meeting based on project cost, importance of the project etc.",

The State Government will be free to choose any\nreputed agencies for conducting the monitoring and evaluation work in their\nStates. Requisite fees/cost towards monitoring & evaluation will be met by the\nState Government from the 5% allocation retained by them for administrative\nexpenses.DAC will evolve suitable mechanism for concurrent evaluation of\nimplementation of PMKSY. DAC may also engage suitable agency for conducting\nState specific/Pan India periodic implementation monitoring and/or mid-term/end-\nterm evaluation of the scheme. NRAA will be involved in the process of mid- term\n/end term evaluation of PMKSY programme.\nThe performance of the States will be reflected in the Outcome Budget\ndocument of the respective Ministry/Department.\n19.0 Convergence:\nPMKSY will ensure convergence with all rural assets/infrastructure based\nprogrammes related to water conservation and management\nprogrammes/schemes like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee\nScheme (MGNREGS), Rashtriya Krishi Vikash Yojana (RKVY), Jawaharlal Nehru\nNational Solar Mission and Rural Electrification programmes, Rural Infrastructure\nDevelopment Fund (RIDF), Member of Parliament Local Area Development\n(MPLAD) Scheme, Member of Legislative Assembly Local Area Development\n(MLALAD) Scheme, Local body funds, Working Plan of State Forest Department\netc. The inputs from the Intensive Participatory Planning Exercise (IPPE) already\nconducted under MGNREGA in 2,500 backward Blocks may be used in preparing\nthe DIP. In most cases the labour intensive works like earth works for source\ncreation may be taken up under MGNREGA. Emphasis be given for utilising\nMGNREGA fund for de-silting of ponds, canals, defunct water bodies like old\nponds, Jal Mandir, khul, Tanka etc. to improve storage capacity and creating\nscopes for water availability for irrigation purposes. PMKSY(Per Drop More Crop)\nfund may also be used for topping up of material cost beyond the specified limit,\ni.e., 40% in the MGNERGA for lining, inlet, outlet, silt trap, adjustable gates etc.\nAll stake holders viz farmers, Panchayat and grass route level functionaries be\nmade aware of scientific/technical processes of cleaning canals, de-siltation,\nconstruction of water harvesting structures etc., through extension activities\nincluding use of IEC, short animation films etc. to get maximum benefit of\nMGNREGA for these works. Other works can be taken up from PMKSY(Har Khet\nKo Pani), PMKSY(Watershed) etc. depending on the type and nature of works.\nWhere irrigation source is created, the PMKSY(Per drop more crop) component be\npotentially made use to improve irrigation efficiency and extend larger coverage\nfrom the same source. Department of Land Resources is in the process of starting\nthe World Bank assisted “Neeranchal” project. Neeranchal is proposed to focus\non better scientific basin level planning, new technologies for efficient water",
    "Information from document 'pdf9.pdf' (Page 19):\nmanagement, community level hydrology, enhanced production and yields,\nlinkages with markets, real time monitoring systems using state of the art\ntechnologies and urban watersheds. Neeranchal will support PMKSY with proper\nsynergy between the two programmes.\nWhere more than one department has to converge to implement a single\nscheme, each department may take up a separate component for implementation.\nWherever irrigation potential has been created, but is lying unutilised for want of\nfield channels, works for creating such supporting infrastructure shall be taken up\nunder MGNREGA on priority and such works should also be part of the District\nIrrigation Plan. In respect of the irrigation works to be taken up under MGNREGA,\ntechnical support of other line departments would be provided. In fact, such\nsupport will enable scientific plans and execution of such works as part of PMKSY.\nMinistry of Panchayati Raj shall also be appropriately consulted for ensuring\nthat local/Panchayat level requirements are adequately addressed in DIPs and SIP.\nPMKSY will also accord priorities to villages identified under Sansad Adarsh Garm\nYojana (SAGY).\n20.0 Department of Agriculture and Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture, Govt. of\nIndia may affect changes in the PMKSY operational guidelines, other than those\naffecting the financing pattern as the scheme evolves, whenever such changes are\nconsidered necessary with the approval of NEC.\n21.0 These guidelines are applicable to all the States and Union Territories.",
